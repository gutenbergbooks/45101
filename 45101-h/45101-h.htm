<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the present volume, which covers the period
1629&ndash;49, the principal topics are the missions of the religious
orders and the hostilities between the Spaniards and the Dutch in the
eastern seas. The final chapters in this conflict are the capture of
Formosa by the Dutch, and the successive defeats of their armed
squadrons in contests with the Spanish ships sent against them from
Manila. In the loss of Formosa the Dominicans are deprived of their
flourishing missions there; but this is compensated by the suppression
of Collado&rsquo;s faction in their order. The Recollect missions in
Mindanao sustain some losses; but one of the laborers therein,
&ldquo;Father Captain,&rdquo; sheds glory on them by his bravery,
skill, and devotion. The Franciscan missions are in satisfactory
condition; to their strictly religious work they add the care of the
hospitals and the lepers. The prosperity of the islands has been
greatly injured by the losses of galleons, insufficient crops, the
oppressive taxes laid on the Chinese traders, and the great earthquake
of 1645.</p>
<p>For the leading events in the history of the Dominican order in the
islands at this period, we resort to the pages of Santa Cruz&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">Historia de la provincia del Santo Rosario</i>
(Zarago&ccedil;a, 1693), a continuation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>of Aduarte&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">Historia</i>, already presented in this series. Beginning
with 1635, Santa Cruz gives an account, more detailed than
Aduarte&rsquo;s, of the coming of Collado and the
&ldquo;Barbones&rdquo; friars; and he adds the punishment and tragic
death of Fray Collado. In 1637, Fray Carlos Gant is chosen provincial.
Santa Cruz describes the island of Formosa, its people, and the
Dominican mission established among them. He enumerates some of the
mistakes and faults of Governor Corcuera, with their evil results to
the islands; of these, the event most deplored by the Dominicans is the
loss of Formosa (1642). The lives and achievements of various
missionaries of the order are related. In 1639 occurs an insurrection
among the Cagay&aacute;n natives, caused by ill-treatment from the
Spaniards: the latter are unable to subdue these people, who take
refuge in their mountains. In the same year, both the galleons from
Acapulco are wrecked, which inflicts heavy losses on the islands. Santa
Cruz copies the royal decrees relating to Collado and the suppression
of the congregation of San Pablo.</p>
<p>An account of the Recollect missions for the period 1625&ndash;38 is
furnished by Luis de Jes&uacute;s, in his <i lang="es">Historia de los
religiosos descalzos de San Augustin</i> (Madrid, 1681). In 1625,
Recollect missionaries extend their work in northern Mindanao, Fray
Juan de San Nicol&aacute;s and a companion. In the following year, the
Moros, instigated by the noted Corralat, attack the village of
Cagaiang; but it is fortified, and its people trained in military
exercises, by the &ldquo;fighting parson&rdquo; of those missions, Fray
Agustin de San Pedro, who defeats the enemy. In 1631 the Indians of
Caraga, ill-treated by the Spanish commandant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>there,
rebel; they kill him and some of the soldiers, and several of the
Recollect missionaries in Caraga; some others are saved by friendly
Indians. The natives of Butuan remain faithful to the missionaries,
notwithstanding the efforts of the insurgents to seduce them. One of
the fathers sails to Cebu to procure relief for the endangered garrison
at Tandag; this is promptly sent, and soon quells the insurrection.
Much consolation is afforded to the fathers in this distressful period
by the conversion of an outlaw Indian chief and his hundred followers.
Some mention is made of the persecutions in Japan, and of the Spanish
occupation and subsequent loss of Formosa. In 1635 the Recollects enter
Rombl&oacute;n and its dependent islands, where they labor bravely, but
exposed to continual danger by the piratical raids of the Moros.
Several of those who occupy Cuyo and Calamianes Islands are captured by
those enemies, and become martyrs for the faith. This account is
supplemented by that presented by Juan de la Concepci&oacute;n in his
<i lang="es">Historia general de Philipinas</i> (Manila, 1788). He
follows Luis de Jes&uacute;s somewhat closely, but adds an interesting
account of the missions begun by the Recollects in northern Mindanao,
which they are afterward obliged to abandon. Their &ldquo;Father
Captain&rdquo; (Fray Agust&iacute;n de San Pedro) aids the Spaniards in
the invasion (1639) of the Lake Lanao district, which is fully
described. After the Moros are conquered for the time by the Spaniards,
the Jesuits claim the Lanao district as being their field, and the
Recollects are excluded from it. Another expedition is sent thither to
build a fort on Lake Lanao; when this is but half done, the
Moros&mdash;naturally treacherous, and further <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>instigated by Corralat&mdash;attack it. The Jesuit
priest at Lanao sends to the Recollect &ldquo;Father Captain&rdquo; an
entreaty for aid to the besieged Spaniards; he responds quickly, and
soon liberates them, also conducting the troops safely to the seashore.
The district, however, is not restored to the Recollects&mdash;a result
due, according to Concepci&oacute;n, to the machinations of the
Jesuits.</p>
<p>The notable events in the year ending July, 1641, are narrated by a
Franciscan at Manila. The Portuguese of Macao have been expelled from
Japan, many being burned at the stake; and thus is closed the traffic
which Macao had with Japan, to which that city owed its existence. A
terrible noise in the air has been heard throughout the islands
(afterward known to be caused by volcanic eruptions), which occasions
much fear among the people&mdash;especially since the Dutch have seized
the city of Malacca. News is sent to Manila of increased strength and
hostile plans on the part of the Dutch, who talk of capturing that
city; and they are even lying in wait near the Embocadero for the
Acapulco galleons. The bloody persecutions in Japan have left few
missionaries alive there; rumors regarding some have reached Manila,
and the writer mentions the martyrdoms of several others. He also cites
a letter from the Spanish governor of Ternate, asking for more
religious to carry on the mission recently begun in Celebes.</p>
<p>A short unsigned letter, dated July 25, 1642, states that the
islands are suffering from extreme drouth. The ship from Acapulco has
come safely, but narrowly escaping the Dutch who lay in wait for it.
The Portuguese from Macao profess loyalty to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>Castilla. The islands have not suffered from the
usual Moro raids; negotiations for peace are being carried on in
Mindanao, and Jolo is nominally at peace. A royal decree (October 24,
1642) orders Corcuera to thank the Filipino natives for their loyalty
and zeal in the Spanish service.</p>
<p>A Dominican missionary who has labored in Formosa writes (March,
1643) a detailed account of the seizure of that island by the Dutch.
After a five days&rsquo; siege, the Spaniards surrender with their
forts there. The prisoners are sent to Jacatra (now Batavia), and
afterward to Manila; and the Dutch make strong establishments in
Formosa. They also search, but unsuccessfully, for gold mines there;
and they treat the natives harshly, so that the latter long for the
Spaniards to return. The writer proceeds to describe the great increase
of power which the Dutch have attained in the East; he enumerates the
armed fleet with which they are scouring the seas and securing control
of the rich trade of that region. All these, as well as their forts,
are furnished with abundance of supplies, of all kinds; and their
soldiers and sailors are well trained and disciplined. The value of
their commerce is almost incredible, and supplies Holland with wealth
to carry on the war in Europe against the Spanish power. The Dutch aim
to be masters of the entire Eastern archipelago, and are planning to
expel the Spaniards from the Philippines. To this letter are appended
extracts from Ferrando&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Historia de los PP.
Dominicos</i> and Concepci&oacute;n&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Historia de
Philipinas</i>, which present additional information. The former blames
Corcuera, and the latter the Jesuits and their schemes, for the loss of
Formosa. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>A letter from the king to Corcuera (August 4, 1643), reproves him
for saving money to the treasury by accepting &ldquo;donations&rdquo;
of part of their pay from persons in the royal service, orders him to
favor and protect the Indians, and asks for information as to ways and
means by which money may be raised for the buildings needed for the use
of the archbishop of Manila&mdash;for which contributions from private
persons may be received, provided these are strictly voluntary. Other
paragraphs of the letter approve Corcuera&rsquo;s course in certain
minor matters, and give him directions in others. In 1644, the Jesuit
procurator for Filipinas asks the king to confirm certain grants made
by Corcuera to the Jesuits at Manila; this petition is accompanied by a
map, and a copy of Corcuera&rsquo;s decree (September 1, 1640) granting
the Jesuits a certain piece of land.</p>
<p>A document unsigned and undated, but apparently the usual record of
the year&rsquo;s events sent from the Jesuit house at Manila, relates
the news for the year 1643&ndash;44. One of the Acapulco ships has
reached the islands in safety, bringing the new governor, Diego
Fajardo. The Dutch enemy have learned how incomplete are the defenses
of Manila; but Ternate has been strongly re&euml;nforced, which will
curb their arrogance. They have captured some of the Chinese trading
vessels, and Manila has therefore suffered great loss this year. There
is a serious rebellion in China; the king of that country is favorable
to the Jesuit missionaries, and permits them to preach and build
churches throughout China; and has entrusted to them the reform of the
Chinese calendar. Japan is closed to the Christian religion and to
European trade, excepting with the Dutch; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>and several martyrdoms of
missionaries have occurred there. The Portuguese at Macao have seized
the Spanish envoy from Manila, and all the other Castilians,
imprisoning and abusing them. Having sent the envoy to Goa, the ship
which carries him is captured by the Dutch, who treat him with great
kindness and courtesy. The Spaniards at Macao are finally sent to
Manila, but all their property is seized by the Portuguese. The Dutch
have seized Malacca, and made an unsuccessful attempt on Ceylon. The
Moros of Mindanao and Jolo profess to desire peace, but their promises
are considered unreliable. Drouth and a plague of locusts have almost
ruined the rice crop in the Philippines, and the Indians are suffering
from famine.</p>
<p>A very rare and possibly unique pamphlet (Manila, 1644) presents the
report of the royal fiscal at Manila on the licenses issued to the
Chinese to reside in the islands. The amount paid for these has been
increased by Corcuera, on his own responsibility, partly to raise money
for the fortifications of the city, partly to punish the Chinese for
revolting (as they did in 1639). The fiscal discusses this measure from
a legal standpoint, and shows that it is illegal. Corcuera had no
authority to increase the tax on the Chinese; there was no pressing
necessity to justify it; he should have obtained permission from the
king to do so; and he had already a sufficient fund for repairing the
fortifications, in the proceeds of the monopoly on playing-cards. If
more funds are necessary, they should be furnished by only the citizens
and permanent residents of Manila, not by foreigners and transients, as
are the Sangleys. Even had the new tax been justified, it was highly
impolitic; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>and in any case its proceeds should have been
placed in the general funds of the royal treasury, and subject to the
orders of the royal officials instead of the governor&rsquo;s&mdash;and
for the sums spent therefrom by Corcuera he should be held responsible.
These new taxes on the Chinese have injured and damaged the entire
colony, since they have prevented the Chinese from leaving the
Pari&aacute;n to cultivate the rice-fields and engage in fishing and
other occupations; and those who really pay the money received for
these taxes are the seventy citizens of Manila. In evidence of this,
the fiscal cites the great increase in prices of both commodities and
labor, due to this new tax on the Chinese.</p>
<p>A royal decree (September 18, 1645) orders the viceroy of Mexico to
send larger re&euml;nforcements of troops, to be levied among the
vagabonds and criminals of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Letters from Felipe IV
to his ambassador at Rome and Pope Innocent X (December 20, 1644)
secure a papal brief (dated November 20, 1645) for the erection of the
Dominican college at Manila, Santo Tom&aacute;s, into a university. A
report of the royal Council of State (January 30, 1647) relates to the
attempt of the East India Company of England to open trade with the
Philippines, which the Spanish government will not allow.</p>
<p>An interesting account of affairs in the islands from 1644 to 1647
is presented in two rare pamphlets printed at Manila in 1647, written
by a royal chaplain in that city. After brief mention of the leading
events during the period of ten years preceding, he begins with the
arrival of Governor Fajardo (June, 1644) and the more important
occurrences of that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>year. In April, 1645, Dutch vessels off the
Ilocos coast are defeated by a few small Spanish ships. Soon afterward,
the Acapulco galleons bring goodly succor to the islands. With them
comes the new archbishop, who dies of sickness before reaching Manila.
On November 30 of that year occurs the most destructive earthquake that
has been known in the islands since the Spanish conquest; Fayol
describes this in considerable detail. Manila is laid waste by it; and
all the clergy and religious immediately go about the city, to recover
the bodies of the dead and console the dying who are buried under the
ruins. The main buildings injured, and the extent of the damage done to
each, are enumerated. The prompt and vigilant measures of the governor
prevent any lawless acts, and afford security to the homeless refugees.
Most of the people leave the city, and encamp in the fields or on the
beach, where the priests follow them, hearing their confessions and
exhorting them to repent of their sins. Much havoc is wrought by the
earthquake in various other places in the islands, and the shocks and
disturbances continue for some time afterward, although much lessened
in force. Unfortunate Manila is next harassed by the Dutch, who equip a
fleet to attack it. Their first squadron is repulsed and defeated near
Mariveles by the Spanish force, which consists of the two Acapulco
galleons, manned with Manila&rsquo;s bravest men. These vessels are
then sent to San Bernardino Strait to protect the Acapulco galleons;
there they encounter another Dutch squadron, and, after guarding the
strait for a month, oblige the enemy to depart. The Spaniards go in
pursuit, and, overtaking the enemy near Marinduque, defeat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>them,
with very slight loss on the Spanish side; and two days later, near
Mindoro, they again rout the Dutch, afterward returning to Manila. Not
long afterward the Acapulco galleon is attacked by other Dutch ships,
not far from Manila Bay, but retreats to Cavite in safety; it is then
sent out again but this time escorted by an armada of all the vessels
obtainable in Manila Bay. Near Mindoro they defeat another Dutch
squadron; but as the winds have now become unfavorable for the voyage
across the Pacific, the &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; puts back to Mariveles
for further orders. The Spanish flagship, again attacked by the Dutch,
repulses them; and this series of brilliant victories is celebrated by
a brilliant fiesta. A later galleon is lost in the port of Cagayan, but
the men and the silver are saved. Dutch vessels capture a Chinese junk,
and place aboard a prize crew; but the Chinese mutiny, and kill all the
Dutchmen. The trade with China still continues, but considerably
diminished by the Manchu invasion of that country.</p>
<p>The second relation by Father Fayol relates the incursions by the
Dutch in the summer of 1647. Early in June the enemy enter Manila Bay
with a large squadron, and finally bombard the city; but they are
repulsed and much damaged by the Spaniards, with but little loss to the
latter. The Dutch then commit some depredations along the bay shore;
and later assault the Pampango village of Abucay, where a large sum of
money belonging to some Chinese traders had been concealed. The
Pampangos resist bravely, but are finally defeated with much loss,
owing to the cowardice and inefficiency of the Spanish alcalde-mayor.
The Dutch again <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>attack Abucay, but are repulsed by another Spanish
officer, and lose many men in the encounter. Two prisoners taken from
the Dutch give the Spaniards much useful information. The pamphlet
closes with a long eulogy of Venegas, the Spanish military
commander.</p>
<p>A royal decree (September 17, 1647) gives Fajardo nominal
instructions regarding the missionaries, but sufficiently vague and
ambiguous to leave the governor at fault if affairs go wrong.</p>
<p>In an anonymous manuscript of 1649 is presented an account of the
Franciscan missions in the islands. This begins with a list of the
fifty-two convents of this order, with the number of natives and of
religious attached to each; most of these have buildings of stone. The
hospitals conducted by the Franciscans are enumerated, with various
details regarding the resources and management of each one. Brief
accounts follow of deaths of missionaries who have been slain by
Dutchmen or by various heathens. The establishment of Poor Clares (nuns
who form a branch of the Franciscan order) at Manila is described; this
convent is exceedingly poor since the earthquake. It had sent some of
its members to Macao to found a convent there; but after the Portuguese
rebellion these nuns are obliged to return to Manila. Another section
of this document relates various facts regarding the islands and their
natural features and products, and the people. Then follows mention of
the introduction of the Franciscan order in the Philippines, the royal
aid and patronage bestowed on it, and its missions in Ternate, Macasar,
and other remote islands; also an account of some martyrdoms among its
missionaries. It was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>Franciscans who took charge of the
Christian lepers sent to Manila from Japan. The notable linguists among
the Philippine missionaries, and their leading works, are enumerated.
The writer ends by describing some heroic deaths of missionaries, and
some instances of baptism conferred in unusual circumstances. Some
additional information from Concepci&oacute;n&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">Historia</i> concerns the controversy of the Franciscans with the
bishop of Camarines.</p>

"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>it is
necessary in this history to take our course from two years previous,
namely, that of 1635. That year was the third of the first
provincialate of the father-commissary, Fray Domingo Gon&ccedil;ales.
The intermediary chapter having been held on April 6 of the said year,
on St. John&rsquo;s day arrived two ships from Nueva<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e524src" href="#xd21e524" name="xd21e524src">2</a>
Espa&ntilde;a, the &ldquo;Concepci&oacute;n,&rdquo; and &ldquo;San
Luis&rdquo; with the situado. In them came to govern these islands, Don
Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, knight of the Order of Alcantara; the
new governor brought much succor, and many soldiers from Per&ugrave;;
for he had made his voyage by way of those kingdoms. A band of
twenty-two religious came to our province, under the vicarship of
father Fray Diego Collado. Their names are as follows: the said
father-vicar, Fray Diego Collado; father Fray Guillelmo Cortet de
Visiers, of Francia, afterward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>a glorious martyr in Japon
(treated in the first part,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e535src" href=
"#xd21e535" name="xd21e535src">3</a> book 2, chapter 61); father Fray
Juan del Moral, son of [the convent of] San Pablo at Cordova; father
Fray Miguel de Ozaraza, son of [the convent at] Victoria, a glorious
martyr in Japon, and of whom the same history treats at the same place;
father Fray Juan Mallen, son of [the convent of] Santa Cruz el Real at
Granada, a collegiate of Santo Tomas in Sevilla, whence he sailed;
father Fray Antonio de Montesa, of the Canaria Islands; father Fray
Juan de los Angeles, son of [the convent of] Santo Domingo del Campo at
Zafra; father Fray Manuel de Berrio, son of [the convent of] Santa Cruz
at Segovia; father Fray Pedro de Messa, son of [the convent at]
Cordova, collegiate of Santo Tomas in Sevilla, whence he sailed; father
Fray Gabriel de Montenegro, son of [the convent of] San Pablo at
Cordova; father Fray Pedro de Chaves, son of [the convent of] San
Estevan at Salamanca; father Fray Juan Uguet, son of [the convent of]
Preachers at Valencia; father Fray Ignacio Mu&ntilde;oz, son of [the
convent of] San Pablo at Valladolid; father Fray Juan Cazor, a
Frenchman; father Fray Francisco de Hoyos, son of [the convent of] San
Pablo at Valladolid; father Fray Antonio de la Torre, son of [the
convent of] Regina Angelorum [<i>i.e.</i>, Queen of Angels] at Sevilla;
Fray Francisco de Armella, an acolyte, from the province of Aragon;
Fray Tomas Ramas, an acolyte, son of [the convent of] San Vicente at
Plasencia; Fray Placido de Angulo, an acolyte, son of [the convent at]
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>Xerez de la Frontera; Fray Juan del Villar, an
acolyte, from [the convent of] San Pablo at Cordova; Fray Alonso de
Villegas, a lay-brother, son [of the convent of] San Pablo at Sevilla;
Fray Francisco Gomez, a lay-brother, son of [the convent of] San
Domingo at Xerez. The above are the ones who arrived, while father Fray
Juan Tellez, a son of [the convent at] San Lucar, was left in Mexico
because of illness, and came the following year. Father Fray Marco
Nu&ntilde;ez, a son of [the convent of] San Estevan at Salamanca, died
at sea. Under the shelter of this mission came a student, who took the
habit here, professed, and was ordained; his name was father Fray Diego
Rodriguez.</p>
<p>The band was received with as joyful demonstrations of consolation
as were the others. But considering the appearance of those who came in
that band, which was so strange to this province, the joy was changed
into wonder; for all of them wore long beards, a fact which was an
immediate portent of some great trouble as it was the superscription of
peculiarity. The first part, book 2, chapter 56 treats of this
sufficiently; but, as it is so serious a matter, we have thought best
to repeat considerable and to add somewhat. Father Fray Diego Collado,
a native of Meazadas in Estremadura, and son of [the convent of] San
Estevan at Salamanca, a truly exemplary religious, energetic in his
ministry, and very zealous for the conversion of Japon and China, was a
minister of this province for some years in Cagayan. But the
devil&mdash;who, like an asp, converts the most medicinal flowers into
poison&mdash;availed himself of the zeal of this father to divide the
seamless and scanty garment of this holy province; and, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>beginning to deface his government with less
humility, created in his breast thoughts of being the reformer of the
province (a self-love, at bottom, which was given shelter under the
holy name of Virtue, in order that it might become more pernicious and
incurable), by separating the congregation so that it should only be
employed in the missions of other kingdoms, without paying any heed to
the ministries to the Indians. He so arranged matters here, that from
Japon (where he was a minister for four years) serious difficulties
excluded him from that field of Christendom. Here also the superiors
sent him for religious to Espa&ntilde;a. He went there and to Roma,
where he proposed to our most reverend father-general, Fray Serafino
Sico, that, inasmuch as this province was embarrassed with ministries
to Indians and assistance to Spaniards; and inasmuch as the missions of
China and Japon and other kingdoms were an employment which ought to be
their sole one: it would be a great service to God to have them
separate, by that most reverend father instituting a new congregation,
to apply themselves to this purpose, and this alone. They were to have
houses of their own, from among those which the order possesses in
these islands, where the languages could be learned without other
exercise than that of the said missions. The most reverend father
having examined and consulted regarding the new pretension, resolved to
demolish it; and, even angered at such a proposal, he deprived the said
father of his powers, ordered him to quit Roma, and not to return again
to discuss the matter further. The father obeyed, but it happened that
the father-general died in the year 28. In the year 29, our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>most reverend father, Fray Nicolas Rodulfo was
elected. Father Collado sought an interview with him, and painted his
scheme in such colors that he obtained whatever he wished from him: the
erection of a new congregation, under the title of St. Paul the
apostle; the appointment of himself as the first vicar-general; and all
things for that necessary end, with great amplitude of power and
authority. The father went to Espa&ntilde;a, and, first seeking the
indispensable permission of the royal Council of the Indias, and
finding that innovations were not resolved upon in those royal and most
prudent courts, without first hearing a report from the governors and
their audiencias, and that he was demanding an impossible thing, he
concealed the facts of the division, and only made public the mission
to Filipinas and his appointment as vicar. There was no difficulty in
his obtaining the favor, orders, and help of the king our sovereign,
and despatches from his royal Council, in order that he might conduct
his band by the usual way. The father came to terms with the
twenty-four said religious, and embarked with them. He always said,
whenever any necessity arose to say it, that the letters of the most
reverend father were so weighty and were so vigorously expressed that
their execution in the province would be accomplished without the
slightest difficulty. Father Fray Mateo de la Villa, procurator-general
of this province, resident at the court, sent private information of
whatever he could discover in regard to the business, proceedings, and
efforts, and of Father Collado, in the same vessel. The latter, as a
man of authority, of example and weight, and of experience, had
sufficient time in the course of two so long voyages to infuse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>his opinions into the religious. That was an easy
matter, because of the lack of events contrary to the faith which they
must give him; and more so if, fearful of the dangers so often
exaggerated, of a ministry among the Indians, representations were made
to them of the glory of a martyrdom, truly fantastic without great
exercise of virtues, tears, and prayer. In this manner did he so bind
them to himself in this holy province, and under the disguise above
mentioned.</p>
<p>He presented his letters, in which the lack of so essential a part
was immediately discovered. The matter was disputed, and the
father-provincial, then the reverend father-commissary Fray Domingo
Gon&ccedil;alez, having briefly considered the matter, resolved upon a
severe remedy. Before considering other orders, his first was that no
permission was to be given the newcomers to say mass, unless they
shaved as did the others. Thereupon, taking better counsel, they
obeyed, and desisted from their attempts; and in a short time were
scattered throughout the province in order to study the languages
there, while the said Father Collado remained behind in the
convent.</p>
<p>The new governor assumed his duties, and discharged them with close
circumspection, and was well obeyed and esteemed by all the inhabitants
of Manila, as well as those outside that city; for he was a man of
great capacity. But he began to advance new opinions, which are not so
safe a thing in these so remote lands, and are generally too arrogant.
The matter that caused greatest mischief, and even scandal, was the
violence with which he treated the archbishop of this city that holy
prelate, Don Fray Fernando Guerrero whose lamentable tragedy, exile,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>and attending circumstances were heard in Europa
not without astonishment; and left this land so desolate that today it
still suffers, and has not yet dried its tears. Reason of state calls
the two opposite arms, the ecclesiastical and the secular, difficult to
adjust [to each other], and this is true; yet in the last analysis they
are arms of one body, and in order that they may live in peace, they
must aid and supplement [each other&rsquo;s] actions. If the secular
arm, which boasts itself a faithful vassal, has to move as our most
Catholic kings decree, it ought to make the ecclesiastical not its feet
but its crown, such as the Constantines and the Honorios made it. And
although there may be dangerous accidents, the science of the physician
who relies on one medicine, and that a desperate one, is not very
great. Such was the medicine of that time, and the Preachers, having
caused notable disturbances in those districts, were obliged to perform
their duties. Much more heavily did the hostility of the governor weigh
down upon Ours, for he, scenting or discovering at this time the
commission that our father Fray Diego Collado had brought (which had
been forgotten for nine months), summoned him, and awakened him, so
that he should again take up that commission. The governor encouraged
him to present himself to the royal Audiencia (not paying any heed to
the fact that it had not been passed by the Council), as his Lordship
was well inclined toward it and had authority to pass it. Much
persuasion was not necessary to obtain this result, with such a father.
Although affairs were in the greatest harmony, still the spirit of the
father was still rankling with the wound. Accordingly he immediately
made his presentation, and his Lordship <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>decreed that those
letters should be obeyed; and assigning the houses of his choice to
Father Collado, declared that he would be protected in them. The father
named the best, and those best prepared for his purpose,
notwithstanding that some of them were ministries. Under military
protection he was given possession of the house at Binondoc, the
Chinese hospital, the Pari&aacute;n, Cassite [<i>sc.</i> Cavite], the
house of Lalo in Cagayan, and that of Todos Santos [<i>i.e.</i>, All
Saints] of the island of Hermosa. Consequently, the province was
violently despoiled, as well as the religious who were in those houses;
and there was a new and never before seen confusion in that community,
the Indians were angered, and the heathen were scandalized. The new
congregation of San Pablo, victorious in its contention, rejoiced. Some
of them, although few, made no disturbance. There were also two of the
old fathers who went to profess in the new congregation (for the most
healthy body has four distinct humors<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e569src" href="#xd21e569" name="xd21e569src">4</a>). A distinct
set of rules were made. Although it was ordained for an honorable
purpose, yet truly, the observation of the rules of the province would
perhaps aid that purpose more. Some very holy and venerated rules were
broken; and at the end they did not pass one step in advance, but were
on the contrary given a great setback. But the true and affectionate
mother, who had given birth so gloriously amid so great travail,
bewailed inconsolably the division of her offspring, seeing that it was
caused by plots of the devil, so that the apostolic missions of those
kingdoms should be neither of the one nor of the other congregation.
She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>had recourse to the only refuge for her sorrows,
namely, the most holy image of the rosary, with continual prayer and
litanies&mdash;an empirical remedy whose virtue had been so proved by
the Order (especially in the protection from authorities ruled by
passion). So was its efficacy experienced in this instance; for after
sixteen months, during which time the pretended congregation of San
Pablo lasted, the Lord worked his miracles by the following means.
Among the many who were grieved at the archbishop&rsquo;s case, and its
consequences&mdash;which succeeded one another daily, with new causes
for anxiety&mdash;one was our Fray Diego Collado; for although he was
protected by the governor, yet being a religious full of zeal,
necessarily such lawlessness struck him full in the face. After
warnings and sermons, seeing that nothing was of avail, he was
determined to write most fully to the king of Espa&ntilde;a, or to his
Council, of these occurrences and significant considerations. He sent
his letter by the ship that sailed that year; he must afterward have
told what he had done, so that it came to the ears of the governor. The
latter summoned the said father, and, talking to him in friendly
manner, and excusing himself for what he had done, said to him when he
thought that the father was pliable: &ldquo;I am a friend to your
Reverence, Father-vicar, and indeed you know how I esteem you and how I
have labored in your demand. I have learned that your Reverence has
written against me, and I am not surprised, for your Reverence would
not have been so excellent a religious had you not done it. The letter
is now on its way to Espa&ntilde;a, but you will do me the favor to
give me the rough draft of it, in order that I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>may
clear up a doubt that I have, and for the satisfaction of your
Reverence, for you are charged with writing false things, that are
unworthy of a person of so great virtue.&rdquo; Father Collado seeing
that he was persuaded with so much affability, promised to do it. He
took him the rough draft, and his Lordship on seeing it was so
indignant that, after dismissing the father, he conjured up the
greatest revenge that he could. He had the father provincial
immediately summoned (at that time father Fray Carlos Clemente Gant),
and restored to him all the houses of the new congregation, which he
held to be dissolved from that time, since it lacked the previous
authority of the royal patronage and his consent. Thereupon, the order
was executed on the instant, namely, on September 6, 1637. The clouds
cleared away, and the face of the sun shone forth, glad and resplendent
with peace. Therefore thanks were offered to our Lord again and again;
and to the most holy Virgin of the Rosary (ever Mary of victory), they
gave joyful worship and a solemn and festival week. With this, when the
royal decree arrived in the following year (which will be found on the
last leaf of the first part), no further restoration was to be made,
for it was already made. The father provincial ordered Father Collado
to undergo penance then, and he observed, with example and humility,
the laws of perfect obedience. In order to remove the scruples that
might arise, he was retired to Cagayan, where he was to perform his
penance. Having remained there until the following year, 1638, when an
order came from his Majesty in the above mentioned decree to send him
back to Espa&ntilde;a, on his return to Manila, in order to prepare
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>for his journey thence, he embarked in a
dilapidated champan in company with some men of the household of the
alcalde-mayor of that province. They left under a good wind, but they
were struck by a heavy northwester next day, before they doubled the
cape of Boxeador, and the storm continued to increase with such fury
that they were unable to withstand it, and the craft was driven upon a
rocky reef. A lay-brother, one Fray Francisco Luque, who had
accompanied the father, leaped into the water, together with an Indian,
and got ashore. Father Collado was about to follow him, for he was an
excellent swimmer; but such were the sufferings of the women and crew,
who detained him that he might confess them, that he resolved to die
with them. But a few moments after that, the boat yielded to another
shock of the sea, and was broken into splinters, and all perished. Of
the two who reached the shore, the lay-brother was killed, before he
had gone far, by the attack of a band of heathen Negritos, who inhabit
those mountains and whose solemn feasts are the killing of men. The
lay-brother gave up his life because of the innumerable arrows [shot at
him]. It was God&rsquo;s pleasure to let the Indian escape, and he
related all the tragic event. Such was the end of father Fray Diego
Collado. [It is one of] the secrets of God that he, after so many years
of voyages&mdash;twice to Filipinas, to Espa&ntilde;a, and to
Roma&mdash;should die at last within four brazas of land, in a very
small boat. But he was already freed from his errors, and rendered
obedient to his province; and he [died] in so honorable occupation as
that of the last consolation of so many souls, for whose spiritual
welfare he gave his life as a true brother. <span class=

<h3 class="main">CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Election of provincial in the person of father Fray
Carlos Clemente Gant, and events of that time.</i></p>
<p>The capitular fathers assembled in the convent of St. Dominic, May
2, 1637, and elected as provincial the reverend father Fray Carlos
Clemente Gant, an Aragonese, and son of the Preachers of
Zarago&ccedil;a. He was an oldtime minister of Cagayan, had been
definitor in the year 1633, and was elected provincial for the second
time in 1648, of which we shall treat hereafter. Honorable mention was
made in that chapter of some glorious martyrs whose lives and precious
deaths were treated in the first part of this history [<i>i.e.</i>,
Aduarte&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Historia</i>.]</p>
<p>Great deeds were performed at that time in the island of Hermosa,
and abundant harvests were gathered, as the field was white for the
harvest of the gospel. But it will be advisable for us to describe
first the characteristics of that island, which was not touched upon in
the first part. It deserves not to be passed by in silence, for it was
for sixteen years the glorious theater of our Spanish arms and the
greatest credit of these missions. [A description of the island and its
products follows. Of the inhabitants Santa Cruz says:] As to the men
they are tolerably clever; they are well-built and light-complexioned,
although ruddy in some districts. They are valiant and strong, and
greatly inclined to cutting off the heads of their enemies, with which
they make merry in their celebrations, dances, and feasts.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e597src" href="#xd21e597" name="xd21e597src">5</a>
They have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>no king, nor does their little ability allow such
a thing. They get along better by families, where the father is the
king. They have no idols or any other images which they adore with
outward reverence. The devil only holds them deceived by many
superstitions of chance, and of songs and flights of birds, which are
consulted in their difficulties. They sacrifice the first fruits of
everything<a class="noteref" id="xd21e607src" href="#xd21e607" name=
"xd21e607src">6</a> to their <i>Berroas</i>, which are certain
imaginary spirits there&mdash;to such an extent that, whenever they are
about to commence a new jar of wine, they first take out a few drops
and throw them outside, which constitutes their reverence. They throw
some grains of their morisqueta (which is their rice bread) on the
ground, and that is their grace. They do the same with the rest of
their food and drink. They have good characteristics; they abominate
theft and unchaste acts and accordingly watch out for such very
rigorously. They immediately kill the illegitimate child and punish the
parents severely.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e616src" href="#xd21e616"
name="xd21e616src">7</a> Their provinces, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>languages, and
settlements are numerous. We found those people who came to us in the
city of San Salvador, which we founded, to be very sociable,
accommodating, and simple. Had God preserved us in that post, they
would have constituted a good work for us and a great company for the
advancement of empires so extensive as those which are near it. China
is less than thirty leguas away from it; Japon is eighty; Camboja,
Cochinchina, and Tunquin are one hundred and fifty leguas or two
hundred or somewhat more. But our Lord ordained that the Dutch enemy
should drive us out of so important a Plaza de Armas. Accordingly, what
pertains to us is to yield ourselves with humility, and to see whether
we can again open so suitable a door by making our lives better.</p>
<p>During those five years five fathers of our order lived in the
convent of Todos Santos [<i>i.e.</i>, All Saints], which was the church
of that city, and their superior was father Fray Lucas Garcia. They
were attending with all fervor to their ministries&mdash;some of
Spaniards, some of Indians, and some of both&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>when
Father Collado, vicar of the new and lately-formed congregation,
despatched father Fray Juan de los Angeles<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e650src" href="#xd21e650" name="xd21e650src">8</a> to take
possession of that house for that congregation in the year 1636. As
associate he assigned to him father Fray Miguel de Corena,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e653src" href="#xd21e653" name="xd21e653src">9</a>
who had gone over to the congregation from the province [of Santo
Rosario]. Those fathers, arriving there with their appointments and the
orders of the governor for the governor of that island, deposed the
vicar&mdash;although everything was adjusted amid great peace, and,
until the first despatch, they all lived together as the closest of
brothers. When opportunity offered, the former father-vicar, father
Fray Loren&ccedil;o Arnedo, and father Fray Felipe del Espiritu Santo,
a Japanese, and Father Corena himself, who was unwell, went to Manila,
leaving the said father-vicar, father Juan de los Angeles, father Fray
Teodoro de la Madre de Dios, and father Fray Juan Garcia, for it was
not advisable to leave the land without ministers who had been there
some time. Father Fray Francisco Diaz (of whom a more detailed relation
will be given later) also did his work, and it was great. He was an
accomplished minister for China, and was detained in the island of
Hermosa at that time, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>the following reason. He had left his
missions in the above kingdom to attend to the solution of certain
serious doubts, in company with father Fray Antonio de Santa Maria of
[the Order of] our father St. Francis. Going to the island of Hermosa,
it was determined that father Fray Antonio should go to Manila, and
that Father Diaz should await him there, which he did. Therefore, as
the latter could not remain idle, he employed himself during that time
in aiding his brothers, paying his score for lodging in works of
example and virtue.</p>
<p>Before going farther, it will be advisable for us to present a brief
summary of the incidents that concern the new governor of these
islands, in order that we may get through with him. It cannot be
doubted that a person of so many good qualities and one so noble had a
strong desire to do well, and, above all, since he was selected by our
Catholic monarch who confided to him in these islands the most precious
gem of his crown&mdash;a jewel that his most prudent grandfather had
given him, when in standing god-father to them in sacred baptism, in
the time of his monarchy, he was pleased that they should give his name
to the islands. That was a very well founded reasoning, for considering
their land, their climate, their location, and their distances,
proportions and neighbors, Alexander the Great did not dream of placing
his banners over an empire of greater reputation [than these
constitute]. Notwithstanding, then, the good intentions of that knight
[<i>i.e.</i>, Corcuera], from that time they were obstructed by so many
untoward events that, although he governed nine whole years, and had
the good luck to return to Espa&ntilde;a (a thing that no other
governor had done <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>before him), and was there afterward governor
of Cordova, and governor of Canarias, where he died, still he left few
expressions of regret here for his departure&mdash;and, as says a
Stoic, posts and dignities bear the letter of recommendation on their
backs only. Few grieved over his absence, for he left the name of
governor truly disgraced. The year after his arrival (namely, 1636),
for reasons of state he sent no ship to Espa&ntilde;a, although he
should have considered the common good and the only consolation of
these islands, which depends solely on the delicate thread of one poor
ship of commerce and relief. The next year he did send it, and it
happened to be received at Acapulco by a visitor, Quiroga, who ruined
these islands by his rigor, although they ought to be treated with
greater charity, for so many reasons. Our governor was over-zealous in
the suit with the archbishop and in his exile, and was merciless in his
decision&mdash;although the venerable prelate mounted to heaven, and
protected himself with a sacred monstrance in which was present the
person of God himself. But that did not avail the archbishop, for His
[Divine] Majesty allowed human power to achieve its end. The governor
proceeded with such passion in this holy province of ours that he gave
it the stroke most keenly felt, by dividing it, without awaiting any
order or authority. And although the Lord derived great glory from it,
still that knight manifested his own character in dividing so holy a
family, and again uniting it when that seemed fitting to him; and by
such actions he showed his scant appreciation of persons so estimable,
and whose profession is so sacred. In the wars that he waged in
Samboangan and Jolo, in which he participated personally, it is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>certain that he did his duty as a brave soldier;
and God gave him honorable victories, which were of great consequence
for humbling those enemies. But they were very dear to us, for the best
people of these islands perished there, but rather as the result of
their own disorder than from the valor of others. In order that those
sorties might be made, presidios were dismantled, and others were
weakened, so that even at the present time [<i>i.e.</i>, 1693] the
islands have not reached the period of convalescence. The thing that
must grieve us most is, that although our arms had possessed the
greater part of the island of Hermosa, as above stated, with so great
reputation for sixteen years&mdash;a possession which all the nations
of the world might well envy&mdash;command was given, in order to carry
on these wars [<i>i.e.</i>, in Mindanao and Jolo], for three of the
military companies in its garrison to retire to Manila, leaving only
one, composed of boys and cripples, under the immediate control of the
chief governor. On that account it was necessary for our religious to
abandon the place where they lived outside (which was a village of
considerable size), and to live in the fort, crowded with the men. When
the Dutch, who were settled at the other point of the island, called
Tayguan, discovered that, they attacked us once; and, having better
equipped themselves, [attacked us] in the following year of 1642, and
besieged and defeated us with the loss of credit that can be understood
(although the conditions were honorable), after seven days of brave
resistance, and took our people in their ships to Manila. But this
caused the ruin of large Christian communities of Indians, and the
total downfall of the increased hopes which, in so advantageous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>a post [as Hermosa], were continuing to grow, with
greater effects in the service of both Majesties. Later, in the year
1660, the Chinese won that fort of ours and the land from the Dutch, so
that that nation possesses it in peace today. The misfortunes of the
governor went farther; and one of those years he despatched to our
Espa&ntilde;a the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la
Concepcion&rdquo;&mdash;the richest one that has ever been seen on that
route and owned by citizens of this land (for then they had not
invented the pernicious art of sending [agents] to buy here). It was in
command of Don Juan Francisco de Corcuera, the governor&rsquo;s nephew.
Unfortunately it was wrecked during a storm, at an island of the
Ladrones, and the cargo was lost, as well as the people&mdash;except
some few who escaped by swimming, and afterward ventured themselves in
the open sea, in a small boat made in those parts; and it was
God&rsquo;s will to allow them to reach Manila. At that time there was
an insurrection of Sangleys&mdash;who hold in their grasp all the
manufactures and trades of this community, and through whose hands
passes all the bulk of the commerce. Consequently by the means of one
lash they all perished, while we ourselves were badly wounded. Clearly
our sins were the cause of all those calamities; but since the superior
officer derives the greater part of the glory in prosperous affairs,
there is sufficient foundation in adverse affairs for him to shoulder a
great part of the misfortunes&mdash;and more so when, rendering himself
inaccessible to counsel, he carries out his own resolution. Now his
residencia has been obtained by his death, and the residencia which was
taken here from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>him was not so mild that it did not cost him five
years of close imprisonment.</p>
<p>[The chapter closes with the narration of the happy death at the
island of Hermosa of the Portuguese lay-brother Fray Antonio de Viana,
who had taken the Dominican habit at Manila. He had labored five years
in the island.]</p>

<p class="first"><i>Of the intermediary chapter; and of some religious
who are mentioned in it as having died, leaving behind the reputation
of virtue.</i></p>
<p>The intermediary chapter of the provincialate of father Fray Carlos
Clemente Gant was held in the convent of St. Dominic in Manila, May 15,
1639. [The deceased missionaries given mention in that chapter are as
follows: Jacinto de San Geronimo, who professed in the convent of Santa
Cruz at Carboneras in the province of Espa&ntilde;a, and died in the
province of Itui, after a glorious life of labor. Geronimo Morer, of
the province of Aragon, who professed in the convent at Valencia, and
died at an advanced age in the missions of the Babuyanes; he had charge
there of about one thousand tributes in two villages. Juan de Santo
Tomas, who died September 5, 1638, one of the founders of the province.
Next morning early also died the lay-brother Juan de San Dionisio, a
native of Aguilar, who took the habit at the convent of Escala
C&oelig;li (<i>i.e.</i>, the Ladder of Heaven) at Cordova; he was
known, before his arrival at the Philippine province, as Juan de
Heredia. He joined the Philippine mission in 1590, and on reaching that
land was employed in various duties, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>among them that of nurse
in the Chinese hospital of San Gabriel.]</p>
<p>[Chapters iv and v deal with the life of Juan de Santo Tomas
(<i>alias</i> de Ormaza), one of the founders of the province of Santo
Rosario, and its fourth provincial. He was a native of Medina del
Campo, and his father was a noted jurist. The latter desiring his son
to follow in his footsteps, he was sent to the university of Salamanca;
but the youthful student, developing a taste for the religious life,
prevailed upon his parents to allow him to devote himself to religion.
He entered the Dominican convent at Valladolid, where he professed. The
first mission to the Philippines, which arrived there in 1587, found
him among its ranks. Arrived at the islands he was assigned to the
missions at Bataan, where he labored assiduously until the year 1600,
when he became provincial by unanimous vote. Shortly after the
completion of his term of office he was sent to Japan as vicar-general
of the Dominican missions there, and after several years there he
returned to Manila and resumed his old vicariate of Bataan. As old age
came on he retired to the convent of Manila, where he died at the age
of nearly ninety, on December 7, 1638. In the general chapter held in
Rome in 1644, he received mention for his good life and works.]

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Of the intermediary meeting of the year 1639, and
events of that time</i></p>
<p>In the year 1639 was held the intermediary meeting in the convent of
St. Dominic in Manila, where besides the ordinary arrangements some
rules were enacted, although only a few. One of those rules was much to
the credit of holy Poverty: namely that no one could ask permission to
spend any money, even to the extent of a small sum, unless he first
declare the purpose of it to the superior. It was a very happily
conceived rule; for supposing that to each religious is given whatever
is religiously necessary for him in health and in sickness, it is right
and proper, if the alms of any mass come into his hands&mdash;even
though it be to give alms, or to aid religious friends who are in other
villages with some trifles, which they do not possess&mdash;to tell it
to the superior, and not to give any occasion for Poverty to complain,
even in slight matters.</p>
<p>In March of that year a very disastrous insurrection occurred in the
province of Cagayan, in some villages retired among some mountains,
called Mandayas (whose discovery and reduction to our holy faith is
treated in the first part, book 2, chapter 48; and which was due to our
Order, at the hands of father Fray Loren&ccedil;o de Zamora, who
accomplished it all). The affair was so disastrous that it cost
considerable blood and not a few scandals (which are yet bewailed). The
alcalde-mayor of that province was Sargento-mayor Don Marcos Zapata,
the son of an auditor of this royal Audiencia. The alcalde, not paying
much attention to so noble a trust, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>deceived by his own
shadow&mdash;and, what is more, by the example of the governor (who
was, as we have said, very decided in his opinions)&mdash;conducted his
official duties by the method which he calls &ldquo;the short
cut&rdquo; (which only shows little cleverness) namely, that of
severity. (But this is an expedient which carries with it innumerable
inconveniences. We know that the heathen, who drew gods out of the
center of the earth, made Love a god, but it is not stated that they
made Cruelty a god. The reason is, that, although it seems to one that
he can do much by cruelty, he cannot do everything, as can love.
Consequently, cruelty lacks qualifications for being called a god.)
Following this his line of reasoning, the rigor of the said alcalde was
great. Although by order of the central government he had made a fort
with a new sentry-post, in the said Mandaya villages, and had a
suitable garrison of soldiers, yet so many were the burdens that they
put upon the shoulders of the wearied Indians for their support that
the latter considered themselves as conquered, especially because of
the ill-treatment that they experienced from the commandant of the said
fort. The mine of anger exploded, because the said commandant punished
one of the principal women, because she had displeased him, by forcing
her to pound rice for a whole day; she and her husband were so angry
thereat that they became the chief promoters of the insurrection. The
<span class="corr" id="xd21e716" title="Source: near by">nearby</span>
villages, which were tormented by the burden of the fort and the
oppressions practiced by the soldiers, were invited [to aid in the
conspiracy]. They entered the sentry-post at ten on the morning of
March 6 with their arms, and killed the sentinel and others who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>offered them some resistance. They went thence to
the fort, and breaking down the doors, or having them opened by the
spies inside, they killed about twenty unarmed and naked soldiers, who
formed the garrison; only five soldiers escaped, by hiding; but later,
the fire increasing, these perished. The Indians entered the convent,
and killed a Sangley, at the door of the cell of the father-vicar, who
had just been baptized that day (whose death, we must believe, would be
most fortunate for his soul). They showed respect to the father-vicar
and, all of them weeping with him on account of the bold undertaking in
which they found themselves involved, they embarked him together with
his clothes, the ornaments from the sacristy, images, crosses, and
books, and carried them down to a secure place, from whence he went to
the first convent. It was learned afterward that they proceeded with
their frenzied sacrilege, and burned the church and the convent.
Although the attempt has been made more than once to obtain
satisfaction, yet those people are so favored by their inaccessible
mountains that this effort has been abandoned, as it is impossible to
subdue them.</p>

<h3 class="main">CHAPTER VII</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Continuation of the events of that year of
1639</i></p>
<p>On the seventh of August of that year, the desired news of two
galleons which were coming from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, with the situado
of these islands, arrived at Manila, which was decked in festival
gladness [because of the termination of the Sangley insurrection]. One
cannot easily imagine the general acclamation with which the news was
received, and the festive demonstrations which were made [tokens of
joy] in the hearts that were so full of mourning for the troubles of
the above related insurrection, and other incidents which still kept
the copious tears dropping from the eyes. Those were the results,
doubtless, of our great sins, which to this very day have converted our
joy into a tragedy, and a very painful one. For on the very day in
which so famous news arrived at Manila&mdash;namely, that the said two
ships were in Cagayan&mdash;because they had made a port badly
sheltered, and had not been able to better it in so many days, at that
unseasonable time so furious a tempest struck the same moorings, that
all their skill was of no avail to them, and the tempest drove them
upon some rocks, where both were miserably lost. Although it was
God&rsquo;s will that the money of the situado should be saved, and
that registered as belonging to private persons, as it was already
ashore, all the other things were lost&mdash;most of the infantry
aboard, and all their goods, silver, and merchandise. That amounted to
a great treasure and was the blood of this land gathered in those two
hulks, and was so sadly shed in our very sight. Patience, hardly cured
from the past blows, was much exhausted, when that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>misfortune became known. Its causes were
differently construed, for in such strokes grief has license to arouse
opinions, however little foundation they may have. But the truth is
that alleged above, namely, our sins, and no other&mdash;which, in
order to double their strength, are trying to leave us querulous of
others, the good abandoned, and the detection of our errors left in
uncertainty. He who would know what kind of a city Manila is, the
latitude in which our Lord located it, and its characteristics and its
strength, must not be governed by degrees, elevations, or charts, nor
by its gains (although these have been so great), but by its losses,
which are much greater and more continual; its site, looked on with
envy by all the nations of the world, especially by those surrounding
it who are as haughty as populous; its nourishment, which, as this is
the most remote part of the body of our Espa&ntilde;a, when it arrives
is at least cold, however great the warmth displayed by the royal heart
of the Council of the Indias. Its governors are and have been excellent
Christians, and brave, for in this regard it has had good fortune. But
since the express from Madrid, even when it is swiftest, takes three
years, it is necessary that the government change its nature. Although
it is monarchical in its form, it lacks the quickness in its relation
to the heart and to the head which is the better life of its members,
so that without doubt it is most difficult to administer. Whence we
infer that this city, with its remote provinces, is one of the greatest
miracles that the providence of God has gathered in His temple, who is
preserving it supernaturally for His predestined ones, dispensing with
the order of secondary causes, to the no little glory <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>of our
mother Espa&ntilde;a. The latter is the instrument happily chosen for
so lofty an end. Espa&ntilde;a, with so Christian generosity, spends
annually in its support a half million. That is the least thing, when
one considers the so many and so competent sons in both estates
[<i>i.e.</i>, secular and religious] as are those of whom Espa&ntilde;a
is continually dispossessed, without hope of seeing them again. That
does not happen in any other part of America. Fortunate is the Catholic
spirit of the kings our sovereigns, who, following that honorable
obligation, so free from temporal interests, have advanced this royal
proof of the most Catholic zeal, and of a liberality without imitation
among all the monarchs of the world! And happy a thousand times those
who co&ouml;perate with their lives or their energy to so glorious an
end!</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned misfortune caused the loss of goods and
lives of so much value, the royal despatches of his Majesty were saved,
and the waves did not dare to profane their immunity. In the despatches
was a decree for the father provincial of this province in regard to
the division [of the province]&mdash;now buried in silence, but which
disturbed it so greatly. As that decree seems highly significant of the
care of our Catholic monarch, and of the warm place that his humble
province has in his royal breast, we have thought best to insert it
here. It is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King. To the venerable and devout father provincial of
the Order of St. Dominic of my Filipinas Islands: I have been informed,
by various relations which I have received, of the lack of peace and
quiet enjoyed by the religious of that province, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>because
of the division made in it, by virtue of letters which Fray Diego de
Collado bore from his general, and aid given him for it by my governor
and captain-general of those islands, Don Sebastian Hurtado de
Corcuera. However the said briefs ought not to have been executed, as
they were not passed upon by my royal Council of the Indias. Regarding
rather the harmony of the orders and the quiet of that province, and
believing that the said division will be the occasion for laxity in the
order, I have ordered my said governor and captain-general of those
islands, and my royal Audiencia resident therein, to suspend the said
brief and all others that the said Fray Diego Collado may have carried,
and not allow them to be executed; and that the division that has been
made in the provinces be annulled, and conditions remain as they were
before the said division. Therefore, I ask and charge you that you on
your part cause those provinces to assume the condition that they had
before the said division, and you shall immediately send the said Fray
Diego Collado to Espa&ntilde;a. In order that this may have effect, I
am ordering my governor in a letter of this same date to have
transportation furnished to him for his return. You shall advise me of
what you shall do in execution of what I ask you, on the first
opportunity. Given at Madrid, February twenty-one, one thousand six
hundred and thirty-seven.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">I the King</span></p>
<p>By order of the king our sovereign: <span class="sc">Don Gabriel de
Oca&ntilde;a y Alarcon</span>&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is the letter or decree written to the father provincial. In
the one which follows, although it contains so many things worth
considering, the clause rendering this province equal to the most
observant one of the order is the most noteworthy; so that those who
merit the possession of a mother who employs herself in the service of
God, and who is so well accredited with her prince, may console
themselves. In order that we may get through with this matter once for
all (which is not very savory), we shall insert here the other decree
of his Majesty written in regard to the same matter to the royal
Audiencia of Manila. The king our sovereign well shows in it the care
that we owe to him, for he expresses in that decree not only his royal
providence, but the anger that such innovations caused him. It is as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King. To the president and auditors of my royal Audiencia
of Manila of the Filipinas Islands: In one section of a letter written
to me by you on June 12, 1636, you say that father Fray Diego Collado
of the Order of St. Dominic went to those islands in the former year of
35, bearing letters from his general allowing him to take over some of
the houses owned by that order and found a new and distinct province,
the sole business of which is to send ministers for the conversion of
Japon. All of that carried with it great inconvenience, both because of
the injury that that order would receive by a division of the province
(which will bring about laxity in it, although that province has
hitherto been one of those in which the rules of their order have been
observed with the greatest strictness and punctuality), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>and in
sending ministers to Japon the said order has displayed so much
solicitude that rather has it been necessary to restrain it because of
the umbrage received thereby by that kingdom. That annoyance has been
the occasion for cutting off the trade with those islands; and it was
in great danger of being shut to the Portuguese of Macan, whom the
Japanese have threatened severely if it be found that religious have
gone to that kingdom from those islands, or from any other part.
Consequently, it was certain that father Fray Diego Collado gave an
inaccurate report to his general, and it was not advisable to carry out
the terms of his letters&mdash;of which you gave me an account, so that
I might have the evil corrected. The matter having been examined in my
royal Council of the Indias, by a letter of this date I have ordered
and charged you, my president&mdash;inasmuch as you did wrong in giving
aid to that father because the brief which he held had not been passed
upon by the said my Council&mdash;to cause this and all briefs which he
had, that had not been passed upon by the Council, to be suspended, and
not to allow them to be carried into effect. In regard to the division
of the provinces, they shall return to their former condition. In order
that my commands may have the due effect, I order you and my Audiencia
to assist in the fulfilment of the aforesaid decree, so that it may be
executed without any omission. When that is done, you shall advise me
of it at the first opportunity. Given in Madrid, February 21, 1638.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">I the King</span></p>
<p>By order of the king our sovereign: <span class="sc">Don Gabriel
Oca&ntilde;a y Alarcon</span>&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>One can see in this not only his Majesty&rsquo;s favor toward us,
directed to the ends of the providence of God (who holds the hearts of
kings in His hands), but also the evil (which the Audiencia here
regretted) of the separation which was made, and the official report
which was made to the credit of this holy providence. And since at last
they see us near at hand, and the good reputation that our Lord has
given us here in His infinite goodness, those gentlemen are grieved at
seeing us suffer&mdash;since at that time we were in so great danger of
the destruction of this holy province; for giving it such a division
amounted to the same thing. But God returned to His cause later; and as
His divine mercies have been so abundantly revealed, greater troubles
can well be reckoned as well past.</p>

<p class="footnote">Baltasar de Santa Cruz, one of the most eminent of
the Dominicans of the Philippines, was born at Granada, December, 1627,
and professed at the convent of Santa Cruz la Real in the same city,
December 4, 1643, after three years as a novice. After studies in that
convent and at San Pablo in Sevilla, he taught philosophy at the former
convent. In 1666, he was in the convent at San Lucar de Barrameda,
whence he departed that same year for the islands. Arrived there he
learned the Tag&aacute;log language in six months, but was speedily
sought for high offices. In 1667, he was appointed lecturer in theology
in the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s in Manila; and in 1669 he was
elected prior of the Manila convent, although he resigned that post the
following year. He was elected definitor in the chapter of 1669, and in
1671 vicar of Abucay, in the province of Bataan. He was rector of the
college of Santo Tom&aacute;s in 1673&ndash;1675, and preacher-general
at the same time; vicar of Binondoc, 1677 (still retaining his title of
preacher-general); he was elected provincial, April 30, 1678, and at
the expiration of his term was elected commissary of the Holy Office;
vicar for the second time of Binondoc, 1684; president of the hospital
of San Gabriel, 1686&ndash;1698, when he was again assigned to the
Manila convent; was elected definitor in the chapter of 1690; was
vicar-general in the province of Manila, 1684&ndash;1694. His death
occurred January 12, 1699, at Binondoc, and he was buried in the
convent at Manila. His history of the Dominican province in the
Philippines was composed in only ten months. See <i lang=

peoples often partake of the new corn sacramentally, because they
suppose it to be instinct with a divine spirit or life. At a later age,
with a different conception of natural processes, a portion of the
fruits is presented as a thank-offering to the divine beings who are
believed to have produced them; sometimes the first fruits are
presented to the king, probably in his character as a god. For full
descriptions of this custom, its observance, and meaning, see
Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i> (2d ed., London, 1900), ii, pp.
318&ndash;340, 459&ndash;471.</p>

This matter is doubtless obtained from the writings of George

<h3 class="main">Preaching of our religious in Bayug and Malanao</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It had been decided by an intermediary chapter of that
province of Filipinas that our laborers should go to the district of
Bayug and the vicinity of Lake Malanao [<i>i.e.</i>, Lanao], as there
were many people there, and hopes were entertained of gathering
abundant fruit for the Church. Since the minister of Cagaiang, to whom
the visitas of Bayug and the other villages belonged, could not go
there, father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>Fray Juan de San Nicolas was appointed, a man well
known for his invincible spirit, and his excellent procedure (howbeit
at the cost of many hardships) in reducing obstinate ones, as was
proved in the conquest of Cagaiang. Armed, then, with spiritual
weapons, he went to the village of Bayug, where he was known and where
there were a few Christians. He began to make much of the chief people,
for if they are once subdued, the conversion of the common people is
not so difficult.</p>
<p>Dolomayor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e831src" href="#xd21e831" name=
"xd21e831src">1</a> a man well affected toward the religious, was as it
were, the ruler of those people. He immediately surrendered his
children to baptism, although he remained in his blindness. For all
that, however, he did not fail to help Ours greatly. With this good
beginning, father Fray Juan endured his hardships with equanimity; and
he had much to endure, for the Indians do not give alms. Consequently,
it was necessary for the ministers to seek their food in the mountains,
with the trouble that can be imagined. They continued to gain souls for
God; but the heart of the zealous father was pierced because the
inhabitants of the other river near by, called Lavayan, clung
obstinately to their heathen rites, and refused to receive the
evangelical law. On that account the father resolved to make a
settlement in that district, in order that they might be subdued by
perseverance. He did so, and left his associate in Bayug.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned, [when speaking] of the foundation in
Cagaiang,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e839src" href="#xd21e839" name=
"xd21e839src">2</a> the great hostility that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>those of
that village had incurred, and the Mindanao Moros. The latter could not
endure to have our religious remain there, as they thought that it was
the gateway by which an entrance would be made into their lands.
Because of them the people of Cagaiang were so harassed continually
that they could not go out to cultivate their fields. Father Fray
Augustin de San Pedro<a class="noteref" id="xd21e847src" href=
"#xd21e847" name="xd21e847src">3</a> was prior of Cagaiang in the year
1626. He was so valiant a man that, although he had been reared in the
austerity and shelter of religion from childhood, he knew how to make
himself so feared by those Mahometans that they called him &ldquo;the
Father Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He surrounded the village with a high stockade, with its
sentry-boxes and towers for the sentinels who stood watch at night, by
means of which they were safe from the continual ambushes of the enemy.
He taught the Indians how to make sallies, to shoot, and to spy out
those who were in ambush, and in fine carried himself as the most
skilful captain. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62"
name="pb62">62</a>]</span>tyrant Cachil Corralat was very angry that a
small village like Cagaiang should resist his power, and desired to
finish it once for all. He launched his fleet of more than thirty
caracoas manned by the best of his men and equipped with military
supplies. The preparation of the enemy was learned, and the father
prior sent to Caragha for some soldiers. Six soldiers and one hundred
Indians came. A sudden alarm was sounded, to call in those who were
distant in their fields. The enemy disembarked more than two thousand
Moros in order to attack the village; but they found so stout
resistance that they returned, fleeing in disgrace. All that gave great
annoyance to Corralat, and he was grieved to his very soul that the
[Father] Captain should be the one to check his boldness. Therefore,
desirous of seizing him, Corralat ordered ambushes to be set, and took
other means to secure his end.</p>
<p>That action was not kept hidden from the prudent father, who, caring
for the guard of the village, also forbade the people at times to make
sallies, that they might not fall into any of the many stratagems
arranged by the enemy, notwithstanding that he had frightened them from
the vicinity. Sometimes he sallied out on horseback, with unsheathed
sword, trampling many under foot, and causing the rest to flee in
terror. That military valor of father Fray Augustin is not to be
wondered at; for there are many examples of priests in Holy Writ who
fought like captains; and, in our Espa&ntilde;a, many archbishops and
bishops have performed great exploits, opposing themselves, clad in
steel armor, in the field of battle to the barbarity of the enemies of
the faith; and our religious opposed the Mahometans, because he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>defending those whom he had converted to the law
of God.</p>
<p>The misfortune was, that the said father having gone out to visit
his parishioners, the enemy&mdash;who were keeping close watch, and
seeking the manner in which they might enter the village&mdash;obtained
their opportunity in a certain part where the sentinels were careless;
and, attacking the convent, they pillaged it of what they found. Father
Fray Jacinto de Jesus Maria escaped, as by a miracle, through the midst
of the swords which the barbarians raised against him, even he being
quite careless inside his cell. The father prior grieved greatly over
that blow; but, like the courageous man he was, he supplied the convent
with furnishings and with what was most necessary for the fortification
of the place.</p>
<p>At that time the father prior of Bayug, Fray Juan de San
Nicol&agrave;s, was in Lavayan, whose inhabitants he was subduing with
incredible labors; for they refused to build him a church or a house,
or to supply him with food. He was supported by the fish caught by two
Tag&aacute;log Indians, servants of his, while he himself was obliged
to pound his rice and carry his wood. It was God&rsquo;s pleasure to
soften the hardness of those people, in a manner that appears
ridiculous. I shall not hesitate to refer to it, so that the divine
Providence may be seen even in what appears accidental.</p>
<p>Father Fray Juan de San Nicol&agrave;s fell sick of the fever, and
found that he must be bled. That took place upon the occasion of a
visit from an Indian chief. The latter was greatly surprised that the
father allowed himself to be bled. He asked the cause for it, and the
father told him that that was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>good medicine for fevers, and
that the Spaniards were accustomed to its use. The Indian became quiet
at that, but returned the next day to see the second bleeding. Then
after several days he came with his hands to his head, and asked to be
bled, as he felt sick. The father endeavored to dissuade him, but he
insisted so much that the father had to order that he be bled. The
barber, since the chief had refused to sell him a fowl for food, or
anything else, thought to be revenged, and said that he would not bleed
him unless he gave him a fowl or two pullets. The Indian had to give it
to him, and although father Fray Juan laughed at the bargain, he was
silent and overlooked it all, as he got some food. Other Indians fell
sick, and were bled, paying for the bleeding in fowls. By that means
the fathers, who were suffering from severe fevers, were able to cure
themselves, God taking that means for the relief of his ministers, who
had no relief in any other way. Thus the Indians became fond of them
and many were baptized. Let us praise God in His infinite wisdom, since
He can bring about the salvation of souls by so homely opportunities.
Some curious things happened among those barbarous people, but we shall
omit them in order not to enlarge this narration, and because those
ministries were lost through the hidden judgments of God, and with them
the fruit that could be expected.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Four of our religious suffer from the violence of
the rebellious Indians of Caragha</i></p>
<p>It has been said that the Caraghas Indians are fierce and warlike,
and can ill endure to be subject to the Spaniards. Having seen the
little or no reputation that had been gained with the Indians of the
island of Jolo&mdash;who, although they were paying tribute, rebelled;
and whose many depredations our soldiers could not check&mdash;the
Caraghas were emboldened to rise because of that rebellion and they did
so. That insurrection was begun in the year 1629, in which occurred
many murders, thefts, and insolences. It is not our purpose to
enumerate them in detail; but it does concern us to touch upon the many
calamities that some of our convents suffered, and the religious who
governed them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p>Captain Pedro Bautista went to the fort of Caragha, and, the land
being in great revolt, thought only of attending to his business and of
making raids. In the first raid he comported himself so badly toward
the Indians that they were very dissatisfied. Having arranged a second
raid in the year 1631, he left the fort on the fourth of July, taking
with him ten soldiers, the best that he had. The names of the latter
were Alferez Maldonado, Sergeant Gandaya, Sergeant Juan Rodriguez,
Sergeant Reyes, Sergeant Negrete, Luis de Alarc&ograve;n, Juan de
Aguirre, Juan Dominguez, Francisco de la Paz, and one other. Father
Fray Jacinto de Jesus Maria, prior vicar of the convent of Tago (whom
the rebellious Indians tried to kill in his cell at the convent of
Cagaiang, as has been related) went as chaplain of that fleet. One
Spaniard having been stationed in each ship, they reached Bapangano,
accompanied by all the chief people of that coast. They captured
sixteen slaves, and Dumblag, one of the Indian chiefs, seeing the
little advantage that could fall to him from that prize, freed seven of
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e902src" href="#xd21e902" name=
"xd21e902src">4</a> The fleet returned and, on arriving at Cheta,
Captain Pedro Bautista and father Fray Jacinto disembarked. It was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>learned there that Dumblag had freed the seven
slaves, whereupon the captain resolved to arrest him. The chief
resisted, and laid his hand on his varalao to oppose the captain. The
latter, angered, struck Dumblag (who was a very great rogue, and had
done many things for which he deserved punishment) with his lance; the
chief was placed in irons, and his cause was put in writing. On the
arrival of the other boats, his relative Valintos landed, and went to
visit the prisoner, who complained because the former did not avenge
him. Valintos was ashamed, and resolved to kill the captain and father
Fray Jacinto.</p>
<p>At that time the Spaniards were without their arms. Valintos went up
to the captain deceitfully, and treacherously stabbed him twice so that
he died. He asked for confession, and father Fray Jacinto set about
confessing him; but scarcely had he absolved him, when many Indians,
coming up, found father Fray Jacinto&mdash;who was now on his knees
with hands raised and eyes lifted toward the heavens, praying and
asking pardon of God for their sins, in payment of which he offered his
life; and he asked pardon for the aggressors of so many misdeeds. The
Indians gave him a lance thrust that passed through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>his
body. He never moved, and when the barbarians saw that, they wounded
him again and again, in the belief that he was not dead. But when they
became aware that he was no more, and saw that his eyes were opened and
his hands raised, they conceived so great fear that they did not dare
go up to him. Thus remained that blessed body until the tide came in
and carried it away, the sea giving him a more pious burial than those
inhuman wretches had given him death. It was God&rsquo;s plan to make
the venerable father terrible to the Indians at his death, so that they
should not ill-treat his remains. It is an indication that he enjoys
reward in heaven for having bravely given his life for God on the
earth.</p>
<p>Then the Indians killed the Spaniards there. Father Fray Jacinto
could have escaped, but in order not to fail in charity he did not care
to preserve his life, and offered it to God, for whom he gave it
willingly&mdash;an action wondered at by the Indians, and still
recounted today with the same wonder. Father Fray Jacinto was a native
of the port of Cadiz in Andaluzia, his parents being Pedro de Molino
and Do&ntilde;a Isabel Lopez. He took the habit and professed in the
convent of San Nicol&agrave;s of Manila.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e921src" href="#xd21e921" name="xd21e921src">5</a> Having been
ordained a priest, obedience employed him in the instruction of the
coast of Caragha. Giving an excellent account of what was in his
charge, he was appointed prior vicar of the convent of Tago, where he
comported himself to the great satisfaction of all, until he gave his
life for the service of God, as has been related. His happy death
occurred on the thirteenth of July of that year. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next day the rebels went to the river of Tago, in high spirits
because they had killed all the Spaniards in the fleet, and spent three
days in carousing. Mangabo ordered them to ring for a mass that he
desired to say. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said in derision, &ldquo;to the
mass of Father Mangabo.&rdquo; The people assembled in the church of
our convent. An Indian woman, called Maria Campan, esteemed as one of
good life dressed herself and went through the aspersion, saying, when
she sprinkled the water, &ldquo;I am Father Jacinto.&rdquo; Mangabo
took a holy crucifix, and, breaking off the arms, said: &ldquo;God of
the Castilians, fight with me; come let us see whether you are as brave
as I.&rdquo; And drawing his varalao or cris,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e930src" href="#xd21e930" name="xd21e930src">6</a> he struck it
crosswise through the face, and cleft it. &ldquo;That holy
image,&rdquo; says father Fray Loren&ccedil;o de San Facundo, whose
relation this is, and who passed through that insurrection, in which he
suffered many hardships and dangers, as we shall see hereafter,
&ldquo;is in my possession.&rdquo; Then he threw down another holy
crucifix of greater stature, and cut it into bits with an ax, defying
it to fight. O Lord! what things dost Thou endure from men! Then the
convent and church were given over to pillage, and a servant of the
convent, named Diego Salingat, was killed.</p>
<p>Mangabo went to Tanda, and, reaching the convent on the nineteenth
of the same month, attacked it at midnight. Dacxa, an Indian chief, who
had refused to take part in that insurrection, hastened to the defense
of the fathers who were in the convent; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>but he was unable to
defend them, for father Fray Alonso de San Joseph, the prior&rsquo;s
associate, was attacked by the Indians and his head split by a blow of
the campilan. It was discovered afterward that Dacxa was treacherous,
and was taking part with Mangabo in the pillage. The blessed father was
a native of Villa-Ca&ntilde;as, although some make him a native of
Villa-Tobas, in La Mancha the land of Toledo. He professed in the
convent of Valencia, and went to Filipinas in the year 1622 with father
Fray Andr&egrave;s del Espiritu Santo. He was a religious of great
humility and very observant, on account of which he was appointed by
the superiors prior of the convent of Baldag in the province of
Calamianes, where he gathered abundant fruit in the conversion of those
people. But as he was very near sighted, he had scruples lest he could
not perform his duty well, and finally conceived that he was incapable
of administering it or any other office with the care of souls.
Therefore he petitioned that he be allowed to resign, and did so. He
was permitted to resign, but rather for his consolation than because he
was judged incapable. He went to Manila, where he gave himself up to
the exercise of virtue, without any hindrance. His superiors seeing
that it was not expedient that so excellent a worker should be idle,
sent him to the convent of Tanda, so that he might as an experienced
associate, aid the prior.</p>
<p>The father teacher, Fray Juan de Santo Tom&agrave;s, was prior.
Hearing the attack of the barbarians from his retreat, and going
outside, he saw Dacxa, to whom he went and whom he asked for
protection. The latter in pity embraced the father and endeavored to
save his life, but an Indian came up and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>thrust the father through
the body with a lance, and he died on his knees. Then the Indians went
to the convent and sacked and profaned it as they had done to that of
Tago, and finally burned it.</p>
<p>[The above father was born in San Pablo de los Montes in the
archbishopric of Toledo. He took the Recollect habit in the convent of
Valladolid, where he became a close student. He went to the Philippines
in 1620 with Onofre de la Madre de Dios and other religious, where he
was appointed to found the convent of Cuyo, of which he was made prior,
being also made vicar-provincial of the other convents in the islands.
He was later appointed prior of the convent of Tanda, where he was
killed. His body, which was buried at some little distance from the
church, was given decent burial after seven years&mdash;when it was
disinterred for that purpose, being found to be wholly preserved except
at the tip of the nose.]</p>
<p>On the twenty-first of the same month of July, father Fray Pedro de
San Antonio, former prior of the convent of Bacoag, had left that
convent. The rebellious Indians, having heard that he was in Surigao, a
visita of the priorate, despatched Ma&ntilde;an Galan and other Indians
to kill him. They found him at the landing-place of Don Diego Amian,
reciting the canonical hours. One of them went to father Fray Pedro
dissemblingly, and told him that there were many enemies in the land
and that he had come to advise him of it. The blessed father asked him
certain questions in regard to it, to which the Indian replied
maliciously and with lies; and, at the instant when father Fray Pedro
turned his back, thrust him through with a lance. The father fell to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>the ground, invoking the names of Jesus and Mary,
with the utterance of which he yielded up his spirit. Many Indians who
were hidden came up, took the blessed body, and dragging it thither
threw it into the river, with great joy and gladness.</p>
<p>That venerable father was a native of Granada in Andaluzia and went
to Filipinas with father Fray Rodrigo de San Miguel (of whom we have
already written at length). He greatly admired the exemplary conduct of
our religious, and asked for the habit in the convent of Manila, where
he professed. Behaving in a religious manner, he was assigned to some
missions, and enlightened the Bisayas with the light of the evangelical
word. He had assumed the dignity of the priorate of Bacoag, at the time
of the insurrection of the Caraghas, and at the time of the events
which we have related.</p>

being answered that they were the son and daughter-in-law of Mangabo,
he calmed himself. In their carousals the Indians had determined upon
the murder, one after another, of the three Spaniards there, and the
two religious, father Fray Loren&ccedil;o de San Facundo, and his
associate, a brother, Fray Francisco de San Fulgencio; for these seemed
many to them. They killed the three Spaniards treacherously; and at the
hour of vespers, Zancal&agrave;n put in an appearance with seven
Indians. Zancal&agrave;n went to kiss the hand of father Fray
Loren&ccedil;o, who was just finishing the burial of a dead woman. With
other like courtesies the Indians went up to see the convent,
accompanied by the father teacher, when one Indian seized him by the
shoulders crying out to another: &ldquo;Strike him!&rdquo; The father
boldly wrenched himself loose, and shoved the Indian against a post.
Then he ran to jump through a window, where they pushed him so that he
fell on his back upon a piece of timber, from which he sustained severe
injuries. The house was in confusion; various weapons were seized;
father Fray Loren&ccedil;o arose as well as he was able, and fled to
the landing-place. Three Indians followed him with lances. An Indian
went to him and said: &ldquo;Father, take this machete, that they may
not kill thee.&rdquo; One of the three threw his lance at the father.
The lance passed through his tunic near his right thigh, the father
escaping that blow by jumping aside. He seized the lance, and, with it
and the machete, retired to the convent. When he arrived,
Zancal&agrave;n went out with lance and cuirass to kill <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>father
Fray Loren&ccedil;o. The latter defended himself skilfully, and entered
the convent, where brother Fray Francisco was defending himself with a
musket from the multitude who were attacking him.</p>
<p>Some feats of arms were performed, but we shall omit mention of them
for the sake of brevity. The two religious were taken prisoners, and
expected instant death in their captivity. Zancal&agrave;n gave them a
pledge to take them to his father Mangabo, although other Indians
wrangled with him demanding that he surrender to them the fathers, in
order that they might be sacrificed to their idols. The religious heard
all that with great fear, the peculiar effect of our natural weakness.
But after commending themselves very earnestly to God, they became so
brave that (as the said father teacher testifies in his relation)
already they were sorry that Zancal&agrave;n was defending them, for
they wished to offer their lives for our holy faith.</p>
<p>Thus imprisoned, they reached Tago on Monday, the twenty-eighth of
the same month of July, where they expected to be
sacrificed&mdash;joyful, for they were preparing to go to enjoy God.
But (as father Fray Loren&ccedil;o remarks) the fruit could not have
been ripe enough to present it at the table of heaven. Mangabo was a
huge man, of enormous strength, and of a terrible temper&mdash;on
account of which he was called &ldquo;the Crocodile of Tago.&rdquo; The
fathers were quite sure that, as soon as they reached his presence,
they would be killed; but our good God, who can draw water from the
hard rock, changed the heart of the barbarian so that he threw himself
at the feet of father Fray Loren&ccedil;o, kissing them and his hands
with great show of affection. He gave various excuses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>for the
murders of the fathers and the Spaniards which he had committed,
although all of them were frivolous, and said that the fathers should
have no fear, for they were under his protection, and that he would
defend them with his life. As assurance of that promise, he took an
oath in the following manner.</p>
<p>He asked for a varalao, and clutching it in his hands, he loosened
some breeches which he had made from an embroidered crimson damask
altar-cloth that he had stolen from the convent of Tanda. He wounded
himself twice below the stomach, drawing blood, which he ordered his
son Zancal&agrave;n to catch in a dish which contained wine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e988src" href="#xd21e988" name="xd21e988src">7</a> He
began to swear and to invoke his divatas, with howlings so extravagant
that he was terrifying. He cursed himself in all ways<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e994src" href="#xd21e994" name="xd21e994src">8</a> if he should
be found wanting in friendship to us, or in our defense, even did he
die for it. He drank some of the wine, and then put the dish on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>his head, crying out in a terrible voice. He
embraced father Fray Loren&ccedil;o, and placed his own turban on his
head. Thus did he finish his execrable and ridiculous oath, which they
call <i>sandugo</i>, and which they consider as inviolable. That oath
was of no little use in defending the religious, for when some of the
other Indians once asked Mangabo to sacrifice them, he replied that he
would not discuss the matter, that he would first fight anyone who
tried to offend them. And he did so, even driving the other chiefs from
the place.</p>
<p>He took father Fray Loren&ccedil;o to his house, and brought out
Castilian wine so that he and his associate might drink it, and two
chalices, one from the convent of Tanda, and the other from that of
Bacoag. When father Fray Loren&ccedil;o saw these, much affected and
weeping, he covered them with the cloth wrapped about them, and said:
&ldquo;Father Mangabo, since you have given me life, I beseech you not
to use those chalices, and that neither you nor any woman go near them,
for I shall burst with grief.&rdquo; Mangabo replied: &ldquo;As you
say, son,&rdquo; and ordered that they be not uncovered, but that they
be kept with veneration.</p>
<p>Then Mangabo arose and took a holy bronze crucifix which
Zangal&agrave;n had taken from father Fray Loren&ccedil;o, under the
impression that it was gold, saying, &ldquo;I am keeping this your God
until the time when we two go to Manila.&rdquo; &ldquo;Keep it,&rdquo;
the father said to him, &ldquo;for He will preserve you if you respect
Him; but if you do not respect Him He will confound you, for He is God
of Heaven and earth.&rdquo; Then Mangabo brought out another holy
crucifix, with its arms cut off and its head split in twain, as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>above said, and father Fray Loren&ccedil;o,
falling on his knees before it, kissed it, weeping and sighing, and
kept it for his own consolation.</p>
<p>Then Maria Campan (mentioned above) went out and brought back in a
small casket the chrismatories of the convent of Tago; and father Fray
Loren&ccedil;o, opening it, saw that nothing was lacking. He wrapped
them in a cloth and charged her to keep them and not to open them,
saying that he would give her six pesos for them, although they did not
have so much money. Father Fray Loren&ccedil;o could ransom none of it,
for he was without money.</p>
<p>[The holy chrismatories finally render Maria contrite; for, fleeing
from the Spaniards up a river, and having the phials with her, a huge
crocodile thrusts its head into the boat, seizes the phials and makes
off without committing other damage, which so works upon the mind of
the woman that she lives afterward as a good Christian.]</p>
<p>Finally, Mangabo said to father Fray Loren&ccedil;o: &ldquo;Son, I
see that you are sick&rdquo; (he had been seriously injured by the fall
of which we have made mention above). &ldquo;If you wish to go to be
treated at the fort of the Spaniards, I will have you taken there, and
you shall leave Brother Francisco here, so that he may protect us, if
the Castillas (so they call the Spaniards) come. Remember your father,
and aid him when you are able.&rdquo; Father Fray Loren&ccedil;o
thanked him, and was taken in a boat to the fort of Caragha. Thus did
God preserve the life of that religious, to whom, if the crown of
martyrdom was not conceded, at least he was quick to suffer for the
faith; and in fact he endured great hardships for the love of the Lord.
His associate, Fray Francisco, was ransomed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>afterward. He rendered excellent service while he
was a prisoner, in the pacification of the rebellious Indians.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Continuation of the matter of the last chapter,
with some cases by way of example</i></p>
<p>Valintos (the same one who had killed Captain Pedro Bautista) went
to the river of Butuan with an order to kill father Fray Juan de San
Augustin, prior of the convent of Ilaya in the village of Linao. He
carried many letters to the chiefs, urging them in the name of Corralat
(of whom we have spoken before, and of whom there will be more to say)
to have the fathers killed. An influential Indian woman heard of the
matter, and since she was the petty queen of that river and very
devoted to father Fray Juan de San Augustin, who was a holy religious,
she had so much authority that it sufficed to keep those of the village
faithful, and they resisted the letters brought by Valintos. In order
to assure the life of the said father prior, Fray Juan de San Augustin,
she made him take boat and go to Butuan to join the fathers in the
convent there. Thus was he delivered from the danger of losing his
life.</p>
<p>Almost the same thing happened in the village of Butuan, where the
letters of Valintos were received urging the inhabitants to rise and
kill the religious. But the Butuans were so faithful that they would
not consent to the evil. On the contrary, reading the letters in
public, they cried with one voice that they would die before they would
permit one hair of the fathers to be harmed. Then forming in a
procession, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>men, women, and children went to the convent in
tears, and bewailing the troubles that they were all suffering. The
religious said: &ldquo;Children, here we are at your disposition. Do
what you will with us, for God our Lord so orders it.&rdquo; At this
all the people cried out and said with tears in their eyes:
&ldquo;Fathers, be of good cheer, for we will all die before anyone
offends you.&rdquo; They said that with emphatic oaths, whereby they
showed the great love and respect that they held for the fathers. The
chiefs remained in the convent with their families and possessions.
Endeavor was made to advise Zib&ugrave;, so that help might be brought;
and the father prior, Fray Jacinto de San Fulgencio, went [for that
purpose].</p>
<p>Valintos, having seen the bad outcome to his treacherous plans in
Butuan, returned in a rage, and the religious were safe. However,
although so many of them were good, some restless Indians (especially
the fiscal of the village) rebelled, and without having any occasion
therefor, killed the porter of the convent and another Indian. Had not
the chiefs hastened to their defense, father Fray Diego de Santa Ana,
the associate of the father prior, would have been in danger.</p>
<p>The other revolted villages, taking umbrage at the faithfulness of
the Butuans, tried to find means to kill the religious, so that thus
the Butuans might be obliged to conform to their rebellion. He who
tried hardest was Man&agrave;n Gal&agrave;n, an Indian chief of the
village of Albucay, who went to Sampongan to discuss the matter with
the Samponganos. An Indian, who was intimate with the fathers, one
Sumulay, was chosen [for that mission]. He was well instructed, but,
his wiles having been perceived, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>Butuans quickly seized
their arms to fight any and all enemies who should appear. The fathers
were taken to the mountains for greater security, and the traitor
Sumulay tried to finish the affair personally. He went, under pretense
of friendship, to seek the fathers in the mountains; but, his evil
design being recognized, he was seized, and confessing his guilt was
placed under surveillance, and finally deprived of life. Following the
example of the Butuans, other villages maintained the faith, and
defended their fathers who sowed the seed of the gospel in so rude a
land, amid so many dangers to their quiet and life, opposing themselves
to the sowing of tares that the common enemy always endeavors to
introduce into the harvests of the Church.</p>
<p>The father prior of Butuan, Fray Jacinto de San Fulgencio, when
sailing to Zib&ugrave; to solicit aid, passed by the island of Camigi,
a visita of the district of Cagaiang. He stopped there and was in great
danger of being murdered by the insurgents, who were going about in
bands committing piracies and watching the sea, so that the fort of
Tanda might not be aided. Although that fort was in great danger, the
valor of its garrison defended it. The father prior advised the fathers
of Cagaiang and Baiug so that they might take precautions, and [told
them] that he was going to get aid. That advice was very important for
the restraining of the Indians of Baiug and Cagaiang, since they knew
that the negotiations which they had with the Caraghas and Mindanaos
were known.</p>
<p>The said father prior having arrived at Zib&ugrave;, the aid was
prepared, and was sent under Captain Juan de Chaves as commander of the
fleet, who was accompanied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>by good infantry. The father prior
also went with that fleet. They reached Bacoag, where the convent above
mentioned was situated, which was one of the best on that coast. Their
hearts were pierced to see so many dead and half-decayed bodies, and
they buried them. Entering the church, they saw the images profaned and
cut into bits. The latter were gathered together by father Fray
Jacinto.</p>
<p>The fleet proceeded on its way, and reached the fort of Tanda, whose
occupants congratulated themselves again and again at being freed from
danger. The pacification of the insurgents was negotiated, in which
father Fray Jacinto worked mightily. The latter was overjoyed at having
aided the land which was so afflicted. That was a great service which
he rendered to God and to our Catholic monarch, who have been able to
employ our Recollects in this to advantage. With that aid and some more
which was sent from Manila, the insurrection which had caused so much
noise and wrought so much ruin was put down. Our convents were restored
and other religious no less zealous and earnest succeeded those who had
died so gloriously for the faith.</p>
<p>[The Recollects, worthy of their great master St. Augustine, do not
waver in their spiritual conflict, but ever keep the sword of the faith
turned toward the enemy. &ldquo;Various incidents occur during that
insurrection,&rdquo; one of them being that the Indian who had killed
father Fray Alonso de San Joseph has the arm that had struck that fatal
blow bitten off by a crocodile; but he afterward repents and becomes a
good Christian. Likewise the Indian who had killed father Fray Pedro de
San Antonio dies repentant, having given himself up to justice. A chief
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>in Bacoag orders his rice to be cooked with
portions of a demolished crucifix, which in burning emits a different
colored flame than ordinary wood, without being consumed. &ldquo;Four
Indians ate of the rice,&rdquo; but immediately burst. Another crucifix
thrown into the fire does not burn, and is rescued by a devout Indian
woman after one of the arms has been broken off, and is preserved as a
precious relic by the father to whom she gives it.]</p>
<p>There were many wild and barbarous people in the mountains of Bacoag
and Bolor, who lived by theft and murder. Many efforts had been made to
reach those Indians in order to reduce and punish them, but all failed.
They were ruled by an Indian named Salimbong, a man of considerable
wisdom, prudence, and understanding, who kept them very well in hand.
The insurrection occurred, and while the ministers of the gospel were
wandering about abandoned and afflicted, God consoled them with the
conversion of that Indian. It happened as follows: the father teacher,
father Fray Loren&ccedil;o de San Facundo&mdash;freed now, as above
related, from his prison&mdash;left Bacoag in order to bury the dead,
and get together the possessions that had remained in the convent. On
the following day when the father reached the convent, the Indian
Salimbong appeared to him with one hundred companions, and said that he
was disabused of his errors and wished to become a Christian. The
religious, who knew his good understanding and wisdom, was surprised.
He asked him many different questions in order to prove his spirit. He
found Salimbong ready, and baptized him and all his men. That
conversion was cried far <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>and wide and was of great use in the
pacification of many villages, which with the protection of that Indian
will furnish much room for further work.</p>
<p>[On June 22, 1632, a report is made before the archbishop <i>ad
interim</i>, Pedro de Arce, of the murders of the Recollect
missionaries, and their other trials. Two authorized copies are made of
the report &ldquo;one of which was presented to the royal Council of
the Indias in the year 1635, and the other is preserved in the archives
of the congregation of our convent at Madrid.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>[The following section (vii) is an account of the life and death of
the first vicar-general of the order, Geronimo de la Resurreccion.
Chapter second is concerned with the order in Japan and the martyrdoms
of some of the workers there. In section ii occurs the following:]</p>
<p>The blessed father Fray Francisco [de Jesus] was not satisfied with
giving spiritual life to those whom he was converting and baptizing [in
Japon], but he also gave them the girdle of our father St. Augustine,
making them confriars and religious of the fourth order (as the
confriars of the said girdle are),<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1069src"
href="#xd21e1069" name="xd21e1069src">9</a> so that enlisted under the
banner of so great a captain and doctor they might be armed to fight
and to suffer even to the point of giving their lives to the Lord who
gave them rebirth in baptism. And from this <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1078" title="Source: circumstances">circumstance</span> it
happened that the blessed father could write from the prison of
Bomur&agrave; in a letter to the father provincial of Filipinas under
date of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>October six, 1630, that more than three hundred
confriars of the girdle had suffered, besides many others whom the
Observantine fathers have.</p>
<p>The venerable father Fray Francisco de Jesus also makes mention, in
his letter written from Nagay, of the island of Hermosa, urging and
entreating the father provincial to send religious there to found a
convent in the island, by which to facilitate the road to Japon, and
help to those [missionaries] in that country. He was moved to ask that,
because he had heard that the governor had gained possession of the
island.</p>
<p>We shall relate what happened in that particular now that we have
the opportunity. The governor of Filipinas, Don Alonso Faxardo de
Ten&ccedil;a, was considering that the Dutch were infesting those seas
and hindering the trade and commerce of Manila and China. He thought
that it would be expedient to seize the island of Hermosa and fortify
it, in order to check the depredations that the enemy were committing;
for one can reach China from that island in one night. It was a good
resolution, but Don Alonso Faxardo died soon afterward, and the whole
plan came to naught.</p>
<p>The following year Don Fernando de Silva went to govern the
Filipinas Islands. He knew and approved the design of his predecessor,
and prepared a fleet. In short, tracing out a plan on the ground, he
established a city and a fort, with a garrison of three hundred
Spaniards. Sites were assigned to the orders in Manila, so that they
could found convents. Captain Carre&ntilde;o took possession of ours.
Afterward, Don Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora began to govern, and as he
considered the enterprise a good one, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>tried to complete it. He
prepared a fleet, and took religious so that they might establish their
houses. Two of Ours went in company with Admiral Don Andr&egrave;s
Esqueta, namely, father Fray Antonio de la Madre de Dios, and his
associate. But God did not choose that the enterprise should be carried
out; for on the cape of Boxeador a norther scattered the fleet, and the
voyage ceased. Then the Dutch took the said island, to the sorrow of
all, both as it was so important and because it was the first island of
that archipelago that the Spaniards have lost.</p>
<p>[Chapters iii, iv, and a portion of v, treat of Recollect affairs in
Spain and America. Chapter v contains the following in regard to the
Philippines:]</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Our religious enter the islands of Rombl&ograve;n
to preach the holy gospel. Some of our rules are reformed by apostolic
authority.</i></p>
<p>This year [1635] our religious entered the islands of
Rombl&ograve;n&mdash;or, as they are called, &ldquo;Las Isletas&rdquo;
[<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the Islets&rdquo;]. That district belonged to the
seculars who were subject to the bishopric of Zib&ugrave;, and their
beneficed incumbent was at that time Francisco Rodriguez the
relator.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1105src" href="#xd21e1105" name=
"xd21e1105src">10</a> He, becoming weary of going about daily with his
possessions on his back; and fleeing from the enemy, entered into
negotiations with the father provincial of Filipinas, Fray Joseph de la
Anunciacion, saying that he would give him that district in exchange
for a suitable chaplaincy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>Those islands were a station and
gateway, so to speak, for the visitas of the Bisayas which were in our
charge, and also in the path of the navigation from Manila to
Zib&ugrave;. The documents having been made ready, the father
provincial sent father Fray Pedro de San Joseph, <i>alias</i> de Roxas.
The island of Rombl&ograve;n is the chief place of that district, and
as visitas it has the islands of Zubuy&agrave;n, Tablas, Simara,
Bant&ograve;n and Bantoncillo. The people are honest, pacific, docile,
and very intelligent. They trade in the products of the land&mdash;oil,
goats, swine, wine, and bonete [<i>i.e.</i>, bonote]. They have a great
abundance of domestic animals. They construct ships, build houses, and
make other things of wood with great skill, all of which they take to
Manila, as well as to other places, to sell. Consequently, as a rule,
those who apply themselves to work are prosperous. All these things
have a serious counterweight, namely, the enemy; for there is scarcely
a year in which the enemy are not seen in that district, where they
commit many depredations, burn villages and churches, and capture a
great number of Indians.</p>
<p>That was experienced by the said father prior, Fray Pedro de San
Joseph, as soon as he took possession; for hearing that the enemy were
coming, he had barely time to escape to the mountains, saving his
person, but without time to save anything else. The enemy entered
Rombl&ograve;n, sacked the village, burned the church and convent,
captured a few persons, and then returned. Those disasters are
experienced nearly every year. Amid such hardships do our religious
administer the sacraments to the faithful, and subdue the infidels to
the faith, exposing their lives valiantly for that purpose. [The
remainder <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>of this section concerns the change of rules
allowed by Pope Urban VIII (December 15, 1635).]</p>
<p>[Chapters vi and vii are occupied with the captivity and deaths of
the Recollect missionaries captured in 1636 by the Moros, who attack
the islands of Cuyo and Calamianes&mdash;which has been already related
in previous volumes. A few extracts from Luis de Jes&uacute;s&rsquo;s
account are added here, as containing further information.]</p>
<p>[Pages 285&ndash;286:] The enemy, delighted at the capture of the
fathers (which was their principal aim), tried to capture the religious
of Dinay under the pretense of peace, even commencing to treat for it.
But their design having been discovered, the fathers retired to the
mountain, and consequently, the enemy could capture no more than the
things that could not be taken to the mountain with the fathers&mdash;a
quantity of wax, a tribute paid by the natives to the encomenderos.
They captured seven women and one man, and killed another from whom
they learned that the fathers had retired. They went to look for them
but did not find them. Thence they went to other islands where they did
what damage they could.</p>
<p>At the end of six months, during which they were employed in
pillaging considerable property, and in capturing more than six hundred
and fifty persons, besides the old whom they killed because they were
useless, the fleet returned quite at its leisure, committing all the
depredations possible. The barbarians took the religious along naked
and fed them on a trifle of dirty rice. Their bed was a wretched mat
without any other shelter, and they were exposed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>the
inclemencies of the weather, and ill-treated by word and deed.
Sometimes they were offered wealth and beautiful women to abandon the
faith. Those were attacks by which the valor of the blessed fathers was
proved, for their life was a continual martyrdom. But the soldiers of
Christ were happy, for they employed their lives in suffering for love
of Him. They preached the evangelical law to the barbarians and
censured their vices and blindness. All that was the same as throwing
wood on the fire of their fury, to make them devise means to conquer
the strength of the invincible religious.</p>
<p>[In chapter eighth are recounted the holy deaths of the three
Recollect fathers, Fray Juan de San Antonio, Fray Francisco de Santa
Monica, and brother Fray Francisco de la Madre de Dios, which occur in
the year 1638. The first, a native of Mexico who had professed in the
Manila convent, had been seized by one Dato Achen, of Jolo, an adherent
of Corralat. After four years of cruel captivity, during which
temptations of the flesh are offered him in order to make him deny the
faith and he is subjected to all sorts of abuse, the father dies
triumphant. The second father is killed by the Moros in his convent of
Divail of which he was prior. The third Recollect meets death from the
Sangleys whom he has severely censured in the island of Cuyo.]</p>
<p>[The ninth chapter is devoted to the conversion and Christian life
of Clara Calim&agrave;n, a native woman of the village of
Butu&agrave;n, who is given the rank of beata (beatas being women who
live in religious retirement, although not known as nuns), by the
Recollects.]</p>
<p>[The Recollect Juan de la Concepci&oacute;n relates the <span class=

of the Caragas (<i lang="es">Hist. de Philipinas</i>, v, pp.

little more than rewrite the latter&rsquo;s account. A few paragraphs
from La Concepci&oacute;n are here added.]</p>
<p>10. Various councils were held in the fort of Tandag, in order to
decide upon the means and method of subduing and pacifying these
insurgents; it was decided that it was necessary to take arms and to
punish them. But they did not have sufficient forces for it, for the
province was so thoroughly in rebellion, and so committed thereto by
the murders of the fathers and Spaniards. It was determined by
unanimous vote to call on Zebu for help, and father Fray Jacinto de San
Fulgencio went to obtain it. He informed the alcalde-mayor and
commander of the fleet of Pintados of the condition of the province of
Caraga&mdash;namely, that there were various squadrons of boats along
the coasts to prevent help from being taken into the fort; and that the
fort was now in the last extremity, and in danger of having to
surrender because of hunger. The commander prepared a suitable fleet in
quick order; he sent some excellent infantry, and gave the command of
it to Captain Don Juan de Chaves. The above-mentioned father Fray
Jazinto also embarked in the fleet. This armada was to keep the
insurgents busy until more forces could be sent from Manila, and the
matter was reported to the captain-general there.</p>
<p>11. That fleet reached Basuag, then a prominent coast village. The
Spaniards experienced the keenest sorrow at seeing so many corpses,
already half decomposed; they stopped there to bury these, and then
proceeded on their voyage and arrived at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>Tandag. There they freed
the presidio from its danger and those who were in it. Then for a time
they tried to pacify the people by mild means; but as soon as a
suitable re&euml;nforcement arrived from Manila, they immediately
meditated punishment&mdash;especially on the principal leaders of the
revolt, but pardoning in his Majesty&rsquo;s name all those of the
common people who presented themselves in submission. Mangabo was
included in that list and number; but the religious, bound to his
cause, defended him with ardor, and interested themselves, as his
children, so that their father should not be punished. The Spaniards
consented to it and pardoned him, and that pardon was of great service
to the province of Caraga. Mangabo, dissuaded from his errors, and
thankful for such benefits, was converted to our holy faith and
received baptism. As he was so greatly feared throughout the country,
that was quite sufficient to pacify the entire province, and the
fugitives returned to their respective villages, which they formed as
before.</p>
<p>12. Noteworthy conversions followed at this juncture, the noise of
arms. Most exemplary punishments were seen and experienced from heaven
on the aggressors, and singular portents in the profaned and destroyed
images. An idolatrous Indian, in sport of an image of the crucified
Christ, threw it into the fire; he observed with wonder that the fire,
respecting the image, did not burn it. The barbarian took it from the
fire and, buffeting it about, threw it down with great violence so that
one of its arms was broken. A devout Christian Indian woman took the
holy image, and kept it with great care. After the pacification she
gave it to father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>Fray Jacinto to whom she gave a minute
description of the affair. The father made a solemn investigation of it
and many witnesses confirmed it and confessed her declaration to be
true. The father took that holy Christ to Manila, the following year,
and presented it to Governor Don Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora. He
received it with singular devotion and tenderness, and determined to
replace it in its oratory with great ceremonies. Father Fray Jazinto
tried to get the governor first to repair the image and supply the
missing arm by another. That most Christian gentleman replied:
&ldquo;No, Father, it must remain as it is for my confusion, since my
sins treated Him thus.&rdquo; With such pious and kind reflections did
he excuse the impiety of the barbarians in actions so sacrilegious.
Presidios were erected and fortified, in order to keep the country
pacified. Thus through their fear of the soldiers, and with the
punishments so present before their eyes, those villages were kept, and
remain even to the present, in entire quiet. However, they have become
much diminished because of the many natives who have withdrawn because
of the severities and persecutions practiced by the Moros, from which
that province has suffered so much.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Wars and conquests in the lake of Malanao</i></p>
<p>1. Inland from the coast which faces Bohol on the north of Mindanao,
and in the latter island, is located the lake of Malanao.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1174src" href="#xd21e1174" name=
"xd21e1174src">11</a> Its shape is triangular; one of its angles
extends about four leguas eastward, another southward for three, and
the third and longest of all, westward. Its shores contain many small
villages, where live about six thousand inhabitants, although united to
them is the district of Butig, with about two thousand warriors.
Through this route they communicate with the Mindanaos, a circumstance
which renders them formidable. The land is sterile, and yields no other
products than rice and a few edible roots. Their clothing is wretched,
for cotton is scarce. All their textiles are of <i>lanote</i>, a sort
of wild hemp&mdash;not that it is that plant, but it resembles it
because of the fibers, which they obtain from a wild banana
[<i>i.e.</i>, abac&aacute;], to which they impart a blue color. This
constitutes their greatest gala attire. Heavy storms of wind and water
are experienced on this lake, and are called <i>mangas</i> by
sailors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1189src" href="#xd21e1189" name=
"xd21e1189src">12</a> [Here follows a description of this peculiar form
of storm&mdash;the waterspout&mdash;which was much dreaded because of
its fury and ravages.] This lake furnished much convenience to the
Mindanaos for their incursions, as the ports nearest to our islands
were easily reached <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93"
name="pb93">93</a>]</span>by it. For since the deep bay of Panguil
penetrates far inland, and is quite near their lands, they thus save
many leguas of navigation&mdash;about one hundred&mdash;and a rough
coast. With such activity do they make a jest of the efforts that were
assured by the presidio of Zamboangan, with their resort to more easy
piratical raids. Since the said presidio was of no use for this, it
became necessary to devise another remedy.</p>
<p>2. For a complete understanding of the matter, we must make a
considerable step backward. The Augustinian Recollects had been
governed by vicar-provincials, who either selected certain appointed
individuals, if the nominations did not arrive in time from
Espa&ntilde;a, or had the latter put into execution when they came
sufficiently beforehand. It was not a very stable government, nor the
most suitable for their administrations, as it was not constituted in
regular form as a province. This reform was obtained with the aid of
his Catholic Majesty, and the Recollects were erected into a
congregation, having or being assigned a vicar-general as superior
prelate. At that time the provinces were divided, and this province of
Philipinas was one of those which obtained the indult. They received
their formal despatches and met in chapter, in which the first
provincial elected was father Fray Onofre de la Madre de Dios, his
election occurring February six, one thousand six hundred and
twenty-four. This religious was a native of Perpi&ntilde;an in the
county of Rosellon, and a son of the convent of Zaragoza. The
Recollects drew up their triennial acts or constitutions: namely, that
the religious living in the missions should observe the regular rules
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>convents, with matins at midnight, even should
there be but one priest, that they should learn within one year the
language of the natives to whom they minister; and that they may not
receive guests into their convents, unless it be the governors,
bishops, religious, and alcaldes-mayor. It was resolved that ministers
should go to the district of Bayug, and that they should extend their
labors to the lake of Malanao, which was a stronghold of heathendom,
but great were the hopes inspired by their excellent arrangements.
Father Fray Juan de San Nicolas, an invincible man and one accustomed
to such labors, was chosen to forward the gospel there. He went to the
village of Bayug, where, gaining the good-will of the influential
people, he was well received and treated with respect. One Dolomoyon
was, as it were, superior of all those natives. He was a man of
excellent qualities, and immediately sent his children to learn the
catechism. Although he remained a heathen, he favored Christianity
greatly. The father went from that village to Layavan, another
settlement on the shore of another river that was located near by.
There he did not find the same response, but the people were more
obstinate in their heathen rites. That forced him to put forth greater
efforts, in order to effect an establishment in that district. Leaving
the care of Bayug to his companion, he went on to Langar&agrave;n, a
move that facilitated the conquest of the lake.</p>
<p>3. This aroused animosity in Corralat, the prince of Mindanao; for
if that district were to be converted, he would be greatly hindered in
his piratical raids. He began to harass the village of Cagayan, so that
the inhabitants could not go out freely to till <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>their
fields and care for their crops. Consequently, the province of San
Nicolas established father Fray Pedro de San Agustin<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1206src" href="#xd21e1206" name="xd21e1206src">13</a> as
missionary in that district. He was a person born for military
undertakings. His native place was the city of Valladolid and he was
the son of Portuguese parents. He had studied philosophy and theology
at Salamanca, but his inclination led him to read books of military
deeds, in which his taste found a particular pleasure; and he became
very expert in architecture, gunnery, and a great part of what is
taught in military practice. He made use of these qualifications and
talents by establishing and erecting the fort of Linao in the province
of Caraga, an advanced outpost among the heathen and Moros. Its
structure was well tested, for it resisted many assaults. He
excellently instructed the Indians whom he converted, in this natural
method of defense, and its utility has been proved in its always having
been preserved. Then this father went, after the new election, to
Cagayan. That district had before been tributary to Corralat, and the
latter keenly resented its change of religion from that of its prince;
therefore, he was always harassing them with wars and hostilities, in
order to recover his power over them. As soon as father Fray Agustin
assumed that charge, he exercised his skill in fortifying the village.
He surrounded it with a stout stockade, well proportioned in its
outlines, defending its curtains by communications of bulwarks. In the
middle he raised another small redoubt, as a place of retreat in case
of a sudden invasion. He disciplined the natives in the management of
arms, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>and inspired them with courage, so that they
should not turn coward in time of danger, or be intimidated by a
multitude, which could not overcome them if they were thoroughly
accustomed to firearms. In fact, they resisted excellently the
surprises attempted by Corralat, who attacked them often with many men,
and obliged him to retire with heavy loss.</p>
<p>4. Corralat in his pride keenly resented the stout resistance of so
small a village, and resolved to invade it with superior forces. He
sent a squadron of thirty large boats to attack it, with a force of two
thousand Moros who were to land; and he ordered that all the people of
Cagayan should be put to the sword. Father Fray Agustin heard of that
order through his spies, and he made extensive preparations for
defense. He sent to Caraga for aid, and they gave him six soldiers and
one hundred Indians. He drilled the Indians in making sallies and in
handling their arquebuses. The hostile fleet arrived in sight of the
village, which awaited them very confidently and under arms. The Moros
disembarked, and attacked the village, but experienced resistance that
they had not expected. They attempted to make assaults by various
places, but everywhere found the same vigilance and defense. Seeing the
impossibility [of taking the village], and that they had lost a
considerable number of men in the assaults, they resolved to retire in
order. As soon as father Fray Agustin perceived that, he sallied forth
with his Indians, sword in hand. He attacked them, courageously and
caused the retreat to become a disorganized rout, in which but very few
escaped. Thus the father gained a complete victory out of almost
universal ruin. Corralat could not contain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>himself
when he heard of the loss. His wrath was all concentrated against the
father, and he planned to seize him by means of ambushes. The brave
minister was not unaware of this, and well did he look after the safety
of the village, and especially that of his own person, inasmuch as he
was beset with so many snares, and as he had to do generally with a
treacherous race. His duties obliged him to go to visit his
parishioners who were scattered in various adjoining villages. The
Malanaos, who were vassals of Corralat, and whom the latter had
prepared to attack the village, improved their opportunity. They
succeeded in entering the village at a point where the sentinels were
careless. Many Indians were killed in the surprise, the sacristy was
profaned, and the enemy pillaged as much as possible, until the invaded
villagers, aroused, were able, by rallying their men, to repel the foe
with arms. Father Fray Agustin grieved greatly over that reverse. At
his return he hastened to repair the havoc committed against divine
worship, and to render the village still more strongly fortified, so
that it might remain free from such surprises. The people themselves
desired to obtain satisfaction from those of the lake. Indians of
courage were selected, and they went to invade the enemy in their own
land, in order to take vengeance on them for their treacherous insults.
They found no opposition on their march. One village was sacked and
burned, and sufficient booty was found there to recompense the losses
of Cagayan. They returned to the latter village without having received
any hurt, and the lake of Malanao was left so intimidated that that
enemy never returned to Cagayan during the rule of father Fray Agustin.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>5. Those raids could not be very much to the liking of the Jesuit
fathers, in whose district was comprehended the lake of Malanao. Their
affairs in Dapitan and Zamboangan having been made safe by this time,
they set their hearts on the possession of that lake. They could not
complain of the introduction of the Recollect fathers, since they
themselves had abandoned all that lake and left it without ministers.
To this end they inspired Governor Corcuera with the idea of one
adequate expedition, in order to finish once for all, if possible, with
the Moros&mdash;or at least to check their pride, which was occasioning
so much trouble to the islands. He charged the commander Almonte, for
that purpose, to withdraw all his operations from Corralat and from the
king of Bubayen with his fleet, in order to undertake the invasion of
the lake. The jurisdiction at Iligan and Dapitan was in charge of
Captain Don Francisco de Atienza y Va&ntilde;ez, a gentleman from
Toledo, and one very useful for such enterprises as he was a tried
warrior. The expedition of Malanao was entrusted to him. He was to make
it by means of soldiers from his presidios and Indians from his
province. By virtue of those orders, he chose fifty good soldiers and
eight hundred volunteer Caragas of courage. As father Fray Agustin
(whom his military prowess had gained the sobriquet of &ldquo;Padre
Capitan&rdquo;) was famous because of his deeds, the alcalde-mayor, in
order to ensure the success of his measures, decided to take the father
in his company, that he might avail himself of all his experience. The
father had gone to Butuan, where he was in charge when these orders
arrived with Don Francisco de Atienza. The latter broached his plans to
the father, to which the father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99"
href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>immediately agreed, as it fitted
so well his martial spirit.</p>
<p>6. Between the two, the means most suitable for the expedition were
discussed; and they agreed that the force prepared was sufficient to
subdue all the lake. Since it is navigable, and its banks are swampy
and cut up by more than fifty rivers, the undertaking would have to be
conducted on the water. Consequently, it was determined to construct
six boats, [each] capable of holding fifty or one hundred men, which
were to be carried in sections on the shoulders of the men, until they
reached a point where they could be made effective, where they could be
put together easily and quickly. They made haste in this mode of
construction, and went with all that equipment to the village of Bayog.
They resolved to follow the way to Balooy&mdash;a path indeed more
severe and more tedious; however, that seemed more suitable to them,
for the way by that route led through the villages of friends. Although
they were only neutrals, their own advantage did not fail to concur in
this expedition. Dato Dolo Moyon, filled with passion to revenge an
intended marriage which had been repelled with contempt by the
inhabitants of the lake, joined them. That union was very pleasing to
our people, for it brought them additional arms and men, and gave them
a retreat and sufficient aid in that dato&rsquo;s village. At that
place their march was retarded by showers of rain. The Malanaos
abandoned their individual interests, and united for the common defense
to the number of about six thousand armed men. They were not without
some few firearms. The stay of our men in Balooy caused many of the
Malanaos to abandon the camp, as being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>a people suddenly
collected without any preparation for their maintenance; and without
pay it is difficult, if not impossible, to keep those people a
considerable time in the field and under military discipline. Noting
that desertion, the chiefs of the lake sent their ambassadors to our
camps, who offered the captain some wretched presents in the name of
the assembly of their chiefs. The ambassadors, treating in order the
matters with which they were charged, asked the Spaniards to go back,
and said that they were proposing those expedients quietly and in a
friendly spirit, in order to avoid greater damages; for, should the
Spaniards try to tempt fortune by pressing forward, only a remnant of
their men would escape death, and the undertaking would be costly and
disgraceful. The captain answered them frankly and discreetly that it
was better to die at their hands, for that would be an honored death,
than dishonorably to retain life by retreating like cowards. He advised
them to look closer to their own interests, in time, and to decide
whether it was more useful to them to secure these in a friendly way,
or to sacrifice them for their liberty. By this reply the Malanaos
understood the firm resolution of the Spaniards, and that it meant
their ultimate destruction. They discussed the matter in council; and
the opinions were various; some believed in submission, others in
liberty. The former urged a compliant submission until such time as,
the danger having been removed, they could throw off their subjection
without so much risk. Others did not approve such astute schemes; for,
if the Spaniards were to gain control of the lake, they would establish
and build presidios there, and would have war craft on it, with which
they would entirely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span>rule the natives, at their own pleasure.
They said that it was more important to resist than to allow their
entrance. That dilatory resolution gave our troops time, so that they
came in sight of the lake on April four, one thousand six hundred and
thirty-nine, avoiding the passes which the enemy had fortified. The
latter did not dare to lose sight of the lake, in order that they might
have a safe retreat with their boats when assaulted. That precaution
was of use to our people; for, when the Moros were discovered by our
men, and attacked, they abandoned their camp and many arms, and fled in
their boats.</p>
<p>7. Thereupon our Captain Atienza put his portable fleet together,
which he made navigable in twenty-four hours. He went to attack several
boats, which were keeping to leeward under the shelter of a fort; but
scarcely did they perceive themselves to be attacked, when they fled to
the shore and abandoned their canoes. Our men burned the only village
on that coast, by name Vato. The night caused them to retire; but on
the following day, making use of the abandoned boats, to about the
number of forty, they turned their prows toward the most populous
shores. Peaceful ambassadors went out to meet them, and offered
submission in tribute and vassalage. Our captain accepted that
surrender, and suspended the rigors of war. In execution of it, the
registration of the inhabitants was immediately undertaken; and fifty
villages, governed by four datos or chiefs, subject to Corralat were
listed. They all rendered obedience to the king of Espa&ntilde;a, and
there was declared in the list to be two thousand and nine families.
The number of families was much greater, but the registration was not
carried on with exact <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>rigor, our commander purposely
displaying mildness with a cloak of tolerance, to those who hid their
numbers. The agreement regarding the tribute was made, leaving to the
supreme governor the decision of the amount and kind. They were not to
receive preachers, masters, or pundits of the Mahometan religion; but
were to receive preachers of the evangelical law, and to erect churches
for the ceremonies of the Christians and the true worship. As surety
for all the above, they gave as hostages their brothers and children,
who were to be sent to Manila.</p>
<p>8. In consequence of these treaties, holy baptism was administered
by the Recollect fathers (who were the only chaplains) to more than two
hundred persons. Their administration&mdash;together with that of other
old-time Christians, who had been made about the said lake through the
zeal of those religious&mdash;was taken charge of by the minister of
Bayug. Father Fray Agustin was of the opinion that a fort ought to be
constructed at a suitable site on that lake, in order to obviate the
easy danger of an insurrection from people so perfidious, and that it
should be well supplied with the necessities; but that, if that was not
done, the expedition was without any result. For, as soon as the
Spaniards retired, Corralat would immediately hasten up to their
relief, and stir up the Malanaos; and, as they were defenseless and
inclined to revolt, that would be obtained without much resistance. It
was most important [said the father] to have there an established force
and ministers. Such delay was not pleasing to the Spaniards; and
accordingly, as superior orders were lacking, they excused themselves.
Thereupon, the fleet resolved to retire, taking with them seventeen
Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>captives, and redeeming some sacred ornaments.
They took from the people their firearms&mdash;five versos and
thirty-seven arquebuses and muskets&mdash;thinking that by that means
peace was a settled thing.</p>
<p>9. Before leaving the lake, Captain Atienza sent a despatch to
General Almonte, who was commanding officer of all the conquest,
informing him of his successful enterprise. Almonte, in order to take
possession of the new jurisdiction, and to assure more completely the
submission of the natives, sent a troop of seventy Spaniards and five
hundred Visayans under charge of Sargento-mayor Don Pedro Fernandez de
el Rio, and, under the latter&rsquo;s orders, Captain Juan de Heredia
Hermastegui. That commandant crossed the lands of Corralat, being
opposed by the fierce nation of Butig, and forcing a passage with his
arms at the cost of many lives of the enemy. Captain Atienza met him
with his whole squadron, whereupon the Malanaos, seeing so many
Spaniards upon them, were even more intimidated; they gave more
security for their agreements, and the registration proceeded more
effectively. Father Pedro Gutierrez came with the troop of
Sargento-mayor Don Pedro; and he gave notice that that conquest
belonged to the Society, and that the Recollect fathers had meddled in
it. But the latter had been given sufficient title for their
introduction into that conquest by the inattention of the Jesuits,
besides the fact that for that same reason, they had been given
spiritual jurisdiction by the bishop of Zebu. If the Jesuits were
occupied in greater undertakings, they ought to have abandoned those
which they considered less profitable to the care of those religious
[<i>i.e.</i>, the Recollects] who did not pay so much attention
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>to these considerations of advantage. The fact
that such territories were without ministers would influence the bishop
of Zebu, Don Fray Pedro de Arze; and he would give them rightly to
those who would occupy them, notwithstanding the great anxiety of the
Society for the absolute possession of Mindanao. That desire does not
give them the right, nor the fact that St. Francis Xavier had been in
the island&mdash;although this latter is not made sufficiently clear,
for the time when [he was there] does not appear from his voyages, nor
does the reason appear from his letters. The same reasons would lead
the royal Audiencia to give the possession when it was governing. Why,
if they were so importunate to govern the island and declared such to
be their right, did they not fill it with ministers? Now, indeed,
Father Gutierrez came forward, and asked the sargento-mayor for the
possession of the lake, and the latter gave it to him in the name of
his governor. Thereupon, the father having taken possession of it,
returned to Mindanao on the third day with the sargento-mayor, who also
went back to his general quarters. Captain Don Francisco de Atienza
fortified the village of Bayug with stockades, left his adjutant to
defend it, and retired to his province of Caraga.</p>
<p>10. Father Fray Agustin greatly regretted that the result of a so
fortunate expedition should be solely entrusted to the heathenism of
those barbarians, who upon seeing themselves free from subjection to
the presidio that was planned and proposed, would undoubtedly reclaim
their liberty; and would strongly arm themselves to defend it, and the
conquest would be more serious and difficult. He would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>be
no less influenced by the way in which he had been despoiled of that
administration by the hurried possession taken by Father Gutierrez, who
uselessly fatigued his Majesty&rsquo;s troops for this purpose. These
interests moved him to undertake a trip to Manila, accompanied by
several Malanao chiefs. They presented themselves to the governor, and
requested aid against the forces and approaches of Corralat, saying
that these could only be restrained by a well-garrisoned fort, which
could protect those who should submit and render obedience; but that
without this provision all things were in danger. The reports of
Captain Atienza, who desired to assure his glorious results, confirmed
these representations. The governor was delighted at prostrating so
hostile enemies, and did not delay in the provision for all that looked
toward such an end. He immediately agreed to the establishment of the
presidio, and determined to send troops for its garrison and defense.
The representations of the Jesuits prevented that expedition, for they
alleged that the spiritual administration of Malanao belonged to them,
as it was included in the territory granted to them with sufficient
formalities; that the introduction of the Recollect fathers therein was
an intrusion to be condemned; that no right was conceded to the latter
because Malanao, as well as the villages of its immediate neighborhood,
had been deserted by its ministers, as they [<i>i.e.</i>, the Jesuits]
had been occupied in greater undertakings; and that they would attend
to it at present, as they had a supply of ministers. A formal verbal
process proceeded, and the Jesuits obtained a favorable decision.
Thereupon, the province of San Nicolas was excluded from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>lake, from Bayug, Layavan, and Langaran.
Consequently, father Fray Agustin betook himself again to his mission
of Butuan, and the chiefs his companions to the lake&mdash;sad and
furious at not having obtained the concession of those fathers, for
whom they had (and even to our times) preserved a great affection and
love. The last representation in which they begged the same thing from
the superior government was in the year one thousand seven hundred and
thirty; but it was not conceded to them, as it was territory granted to
the Society; and the latter always resisted such a change,
notwithstanding that the demarcation was very doubtful.</p>
<p>11. Corcuera determined, after the hostilities had been quieted,
that the infantry captain Don Pedro Bermudez de Castro should go with
fifty Spaniards and five hundred Indians from Bohol, to fortify the
lake, and preserve what had been gained; or to employ themselves in its
recovery, if it had suffered any disturbances. The governor gave the
captain the hostages who had been detained to assure confidence, after
having treated them kindly and given them presents, in order that the
surrender might be more voluntary. The Jesuit fathers went with that
contingent of troops, the superior being Father Diego Pati&ntilde;o,
and his associate Father Gregorio Belin. They accompanied Captain
Vermudez to the lake to make the fortification that had been
determined, and the permanent presidio wherever it should prove most
suitable. They did not find the lake so peaceful as Captain Atienza had
left it. The natives thought of nothing less than the subjection and
the tribute paying of vassalage; and as soon as they had recovered from
the fright into which that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>invasion had thrown them, then
they overthrew all the crosses and burned the small buildings that had
served as churches. Their fury was still more excited when the chiefs
returned without the beloved pledges of the hostages who had been given
up; for, considering these already dead or captive, they burned to
avenge them. That fury was somewhat assuaged when the new troop gave
them their brothers and children, who spread abroad the kindness of the
governor. But that was not sufficient to overcome the course of their
mistrust; they were somewhat appeased, but all was only pretense, in
order to conceal their hostile minds. They tried to quiet our
suspicions, and showed themselves repentant for what had happened. They
aided with their labor as far as necessary in the building of the fort,
but their falsity was soon apparent. Suddenly they suspended their aid
and failed in their intercourse as friends, and busied themselves in
the preparation of obstacles and injury [to our people]. Their former
decision had been rebuked by Corralat; and he, being an astute man,
told them that such submission was arrant nonsense, and he brought
forward cogent arguments, which excited their fears and distrust. He
told them that they did not know to what that surrender bound them, and
that it was nothing else than a toilsome slavery under the domination
of the Spaniards. He bid them look at the nations subjected to us, and
these would be seen to be reduced to extreme misery. Let them
contemplate the Tag&aacute;logs and the Visayans, whom any Spaniard
whatever could trample under foot; and if they were not of better stuff
than these, they must not expect better treatment. They would be
obliged to row, to toil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>at the shipbuilding, and on other
public works, and would only experience severe treatment in doing
these. With these commonplace arguments, and without reflecting on the
tyrannical dominion of Corralat, the latter reduced those unhappy
creatures to the last stage of desperation. He offered to give them his
aid, and to employ the strength of his kingdom in their
defense&mdash;[saying that] even if the Spaniards were successful, it
meant only the loss of harvests for one year, but that they would
obtain their liberty at that small cost. All found it advisable.
Manindin, the petty king of Butig, recognized that, if the Spaniards
were masters of the lake, his authority was in danger. Corralat,
surrounded in all parts, and pressed by our arms, beheld his greatness
very much reduced to a very few leguas of coast. It was important to
him that the diverted undertakings should have no effect in any part,
so that time and expenses should cause them to desist. Consequently,
these chiefs so stirred up those of the lake that they agreed to resist
with all their power.</p>
<p>12. They carried their agreement into execution, and attacked the
fort with so great fury that they imagined that they were going to
defeat the Spaniards completely. They besieged the fort with all the
severity of war. They made their circumvallation, which they set with
stakes and ravelins at intervals, for the defense of their precincts.
The fort was then half-finished, and the captain rallied as well as he
could to its defense. He met the necessity as a prudent and valiant
man, so that he obliged the natives to try other artifices. They built
upon the lake some high towers on rafts, which they moored with a
rattan cable, which held an anchor that was fastened <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>to
the ground, which they were able to do easily under cover of the night.
They had another cable, arranged similarly, across the lake. With the
first one, without any possibility of their being discovered, they
hauled or pulled until they reached the proper position, whence they
could discharge their firearms with effect. That being done, they
retired beyond the range of the fort to load their pieces, and then
returned to the combat with the same industry. The operation of
bomb-vessels in the bombardment of any city or castle is no different.
It is an ingenious invention, but not without great risk. Although
truly those small castles built upon the rafts were very ingenious,
they could not be of great resistance. Neither can we persuade
ourselves that our artillery would remain quiet; and even if it did,
the Moro scheme was very imperfect, because they accomplished nothing
by such artifice. The captain and his men resisted valiantly, and
unceasingly. But they were afflicted by another most invincible enemy,
namely, the lack of provisions. If the Malanaos were to continue in
their obstinacy, they would at last conquer the Spaniards through
hunger. However, the continual fatigue by day and night was not
inconsiderable, and must necessarily at the last sap their forces, and
even first finish them all; for the bombardment was killing some of
them.</p>
<p>13. Such reflections forced the Spaniards to have recourse to other
avenues. They sent a despatch to Caraga to the alcalde-mayor, and
another to Butuan to father Fray Agustin, asking them to aid them in
that conflict without delay. The more significant despatch was that
from Father Belin to the father at Butuan. In it he declared that it
was impossible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>to endure, and that those at that lake would all
perish. He begged the father for God&rsquo;s sake, for whom he had
sacrificed himself to reduce and conquer it, to aid them with the
greatest force of that district; for their remedy consisted in his
Reverence. He said that the enemy had captured three boats from them,
and, all the roads to the beach being cut off, it was impossible to get
help in. One who attempted to bring help had been cut off by so great a
force of Butig and of the men of Corralat, in an ambush of more than
four thousand Moros, who threw the rearguard and the vanguard into
disorder; and that the father himself had gone out when they heard the
shots, with men to protect the convoy. With his aid the Moros were put
to flight after having killed some Spaniards and men of Bojol. By that
means they succeeded in getting some loads of rice into the fort,
enough to supply them for a month if they only had one meal per day.
But so great a multitude of Moros were coming to take part in the
blockade that, if he did [not] succor them, it was impossible for them
not to perish. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let your Reverence
forget your grievances; and I give you my word, on my profession
[<i>i.e.</i>, as a priest], to so influence the governor and my order
that your Reverence and your holy associates will obtain what you have
so labored for. Consider the honor of the king of Espa&ntilde;a, the
obligations with which you were born, and the charity which obliges you
on this occasion to come to the succor of this troop, unfortunate in
not having merited your Reverence&rsquo;s company. Without it, surely,
Captain Don Francisco would not have had the good fortune that he had
and obtained, although he opposed leaving <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>a presidio here.
Father, there is danger in delay. I petition your Reverence, for the
love of God and that of His Mother, and I hope for a great aid from
all, etc. March nine, one thousand six hundred and forty. Your
Reverence&rsquo;s servant,</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">Gregorio Belin</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>14. This despatch reached Butuan at a time when the alcalde-mayor,
Atienza, was there. Each one received his letter. Attentive to the
urgency of the danger, they arranged a speedy relief expedition. The
&ldquo;Padre Capitan,&rdquo; Fray Agustin, and the alcalde-mayor set
out in that expedition with what men they could gather on the spur of
the moment, marching across mountains and conquering innumerable
difficulties, at the cost of immense hardships. Finally, they reached
their destination, making a jest of the passes filled with the enemy
when they came within sight of the besieged presidio. The fort was so
beset that its occupants no longer had any hopes of relief; for the
Moros, seeing their inventions of the rafts frustrated, arranged on
land some strong carts mounted on four wheels, which they filled with
straw and dry grass. They pushed these carts near the fort, and setting
fire to that combustible material, continued their bombarding under
cover of that heavy smoke. That would have proved so offensive to the
besieged, and much worse had the fire caught the fort, that they would
have been obliged to burn or surrender. But before those contrivances
were finished, the universal hunger which was weakening their stomachs
was proving more cruel than they; for the magazines contained only wine
for the masses, and hosts. They determined to take the last communion,
and to give up their lives to such ravage, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>on
the twenty-ninth day of so desperate a siege. The sight of the two
captains rejoiced the fort. They undertook to break up the siege.
Arranging their troops in order and drawing them up in military array,
they attacked sword in hand, and with so great valor and spirit that
they caused the position to be evacuated in less than two hours, and
freed that presidio, which was well near its ruin, from all the
enemy.</p>
<p>15. Once masters of themselves, the Spaniards discussed a bloody
vengeance. They fitted up a boat, together with the other one that they
had captured. Then sailing out on the lake, they were joined by some
large boats, so that they formed a considerable squadron, with which
they attacked the settlements. Those settlements were deserted, because
all had taken to the mountains, after ruining their houses and
destroying their fields. It was a warning, to all, of the little
advance that the war made when they thus yielded the field to the
soldiers. Captain Vermudez, having been despatched, finished burning
and destroying the little that had remained. In order not to expose the
troops to another and more severe siege, he considered that expense and
fatigue as a useless thing, and determined to retreat, and with those
arms and stores to fortify Bayug. He left the arrangement of it to the
skill of father Fray Agustin, who so conducted the retreat in the
marches of the men and in the transportation of the artillery, that he
did not lose a single man, although there were ambushes and dangerous
passes. For so brilliant a feat, Father Belin and Captains Atienza and
Vermudez compared him in their letters to the heroes most renowned in
valor and military skill, so much did they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>accredit his conduct. Had it not been a scheme
of the Jesuits, these achievements would have led to his remaining with
Captain Vermudez; and the fort would have been completed, and his fame
alone would have subdued these Moros. But the Jesuits caused such
troubles that the well-planned and extensive arrangements of the
superior government were of none effect. Therefore he descended to the
seashore with all the men, and they erected a fort upon the bar of the
river of Iligan. The men of the garrison were left in charge of
Adjutant Francisco Alfaro, a man of valor and experience, who was
accustomed to fighting with the Moros. Captain Vermudez returned to
Manila to make a full report of occurrences to the governor, and the
necessity of the final decision. The matter rested at this point for
the time being. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"

San Pedro (whose family name was Rodriguez) was born in Braganza,
Portugal, in 1599; he studied in the university of Salamanca, afterward
entering the Recollect convent at Valladolid, making his profession in
1619. At Portillo, he devoted himself to the study of mathematics, and
especially of military science&mdash;to such an extent that &ldquo;his
superiors commanded him to desist from these, as unsuited to the
religious profession.&rdquo; In 1623 he departed for the Philippines,
where he was assigned to the Mindanao field, spending therein many
years; his military studies were here made useful in defending the
missions against Moro raids, and training the Christian Indians to
fight their enemies successfully; and he was known throughout the
Philippines as &ldquo;Padre Capitan&rdquo;&mdash;which name is also
applied to a village on the northern coast of Mindanao, southwest of
Iligan. Fray Agustin was sent to Rombl&oacute;n soon after the Lanao
expeditions here related to fortify the villages there and instruct the
natives in the art of war, that island being one of those subject to
Moro incursions. He died in 1653. (See <i lang="es">Prov. de S. Nicolas

of slaves in Mindanao by the Spaniards (which had often been urged as
one of the best methods of subduing those fierce people) was legalized
by the following law: &ldquo;The islands of Mindanao are adjacent to
those of the district of the Filipinas. Their natives, who have adopted
the religion of Mahomet, have rebelled; and since then, in alliance
with the enemies of this crown, they have done great harm to our
vassals. In order to facilitate their punishment, it has been deemed an
efficacious corrective to declare that those who should be captured in
war be made slaves. We order that such be done; but that this
distinction be observed, namely, that if the said Mindanaos be simply
heathen, they be not regarded as slaves; but if they be Moors by nation
and birth, and shall go to other islands to introduce their dogmas or
teach their Mahometan religion, or make war on the Spaniards or Indians
who are subject to us, or hinder our royal service, then in that case
they may be made slaves. But those who are Indians and shall have
become Mahometans shall not be made slaves. Such will be persuaded by
lawful and kind methods to be converted to our holy Catholic
faith.&rdquo; [Felipe II, July 4, 1570; Felipe III, May 29, 1620;

administer justice, the following imprecation: &lsquo;May a baneful

<h2 class="main">NEWS FROM FILIPINAS, 1640&ndash;42</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first"><i>A true account by the discalced religious of the
convent of St. Francis of Filipinas, to be sent to the reverend fathers
and superiors of the order; containing in substance all that happened
in those parts and in Japon from the month of June, 1640 to the
twenty-sixth of July in 1641. Notable miracles; glorious martyrdoms;
discoveries of new provinces, rich and fertile; likewise news from the
governor of Terrenate, and other matters.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Japanese have expelled from their kingdom all the
Portuguese of Macan who were there trading, notifying them that they
were not to return, under pain of death and loss of property. It seemed
to the Portuguese of Macan that Japon would change its decree if they
carried assurance from Filipinas that no religious would be sent to
Japon. With this embassy prominent persons came to Manila, in the name
of the city of Macan, to whom the archbishop, the governor, and all the
authorities and religious orders conceded, if not all that was asked,
at least what seemed to them sufficient for the purpose. This probably
would have been satisfactory, had the disposition of the people of
Macan been consistent; but while the question of what ought to be done
was still being debated in Manila, they, without waiting for the final
decision, departed for Japon (so the fullest account says). Upon
arriving in that country, the Japanese inflicted death, which is
regarded as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>that of martyrs, upon sixty or more persons who
sailed the ship of the embassy, burning them and the goods that they
carried. Thirteen or fourteen persons of the most ordinary class were
spared, that they might carry the news to Macan. Thus was closed the
traffic which that city had with Japon, which kept Macan alive and to
which it owed its existence.</p>
<p>In the year 41 on the fourth of January, at nine o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, in all parts of these islands, the noise in the air of
musketry, artillery, and war drums was very distinctly and clearly
heard; and in whatever town or place it was heard, it seemed to be
about half a legua distant. This has given much cause for reflection,
because, although they say there has been a loud noise from a volcano
which was in a state of eruption in the kingdom of Mindanao,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1296src" href="#xd21e1296" name="xd21e1296src">1</a>
that does not seem to be a satisfactory explanation. Since the various
parts of the islands are so distant and separated, and the wind must
necessarily carry the sound to some parts, and drive it away from
others, it does not seem possible for the sound to be alike everywhere.
Among the common people it is considered a prodigy, and causes not a
little dread&mdash;especially on account of the Sangley still being
exasperated at the deaths and punishment of his people in the
insurrection of last year; and because the said Sangleys have made
friends with the Dutch, who are powerful in these parts by the seizure
of Malaca.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1299src" href="#xd21e1299" name=

<p>During the month of May of this year, news arrived from reliable
source that the said city of Malaca had been taken&mdash;some say
through famine [of the besieged]; while others say it would not have
been taken had there not been traitors within the city, who delivered
it up. This was a great loss; and in writing of it the governor of
Terrenate, Don Francisco Suarez de Figueroa says:</p>

understand that it was known who they were, through letters by certain
persons from Macazar who went to that city. This is the greatest loss
that has been suffered in these parts. It is also said that by August
next twenty-five ships will come here, and that they are to go to

<h3 class="main">Paragraph from the letter of father Fray Antonio de
Santa Maria</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In regard to the fears that were prevalent, Father
Antonio de Santa Maria, lecturer in theology and a trustworthy
religious, wrote from Macan the following paragraph:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the month of August last it was said in M [<i>blank
space in original; probably</i> &ldquo;Macao that a&rdquo;] grand
mandarin of war, Yguan by name, intended to go to Manila to avenge the
deaths of his countrymen. He was a notable pirate, but is now said to
be a friend of the Dutch, though he formerly gave battle to them and
sometimes burned their ships. He has with him a number of negroes,
fugitives from Macan, who understand very well the management of
firearms. It would not be a mistake to be on the lookout for them, and
be supplied with provisions and munition, because the Dutch are very
arrogant. In China they have lost their fear of the Spaniards; and
Filipinas, when I left there, were without men or vessels. Thus it
would be seen that this colony is actively threatened from all parts
and has great reason for fear. With the insurrection and war of the
Sangleys, and with the previous wars in Mindanao and Jol&oacute;, the
largest and best part of the troops were destroyed; and those who were
left are occupied in many garrisons.&rdquo; Here ends the quotation
from the letter of Fray Antonio.</p>
<p>The three Dutch ships which, the governor of Terrenate wrote, had
started for these islands about the eighth of April, arrived at the
Embocadero and cape of Espiritu Santo on the twenty-seventh of said
month; and thus far we know not whether they have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>set
out from there. On the other hand, daily advices come of the great
vigilance with which they scour those waters in various parts, in order
to seize the ships that are going or coming from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;for which purpose they have a patache which goes
ten leguas to sea in the direction of the parallel of eleven and
one-half degrees, which is the route by which the ships [from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a] must come. They also have others, five or six lanchas or
small boats, with which they run from place to place in order to give
warning to the galleons that are in port. While this colony was in the
distress that this emergency must cause, our Lord was pleased to bring
the ship from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a this year, miraculously, from among
its enemies without their seeing it. It made port outside the
Embocadero, at a place called Borongan, on the second of July this
year; and on the nineteenth of the said month a Spaniard arrived in
this city with a letter from a father of the Society, in which he
announced that the ship had arrived that day. He said that it came with
Don N. Pacheco as commander and that the commander who went from here
had died; and that many of our religious were coming, and others of St.
Augustine. Thus and thus writes the said father of the Society, because
another had written it to him; it is now one week that we have been
waiting for the packets and advices, and today, the twenty-sixth of
July, we have no news of a soul that had been aboard the ship, nor even
a letter from that place. Our perplexity begins anew, and some even
doubt whether the ship has reached land. If it has arrived, God brings

<h3 class="main">Another paragraph from the letter of father Fray
Antonio de Santa Maria</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;They say also that the following prodigies have
occurred in the kingdom of China. In Pequin, where the court is, they
say there was a dense darkness for the space of three days; cinders
rained in other parts. The earth gushed forth blood, and a quantity of
it was caught in vases. A bell in one of their temples rang of its own
accord; and the rocks, when struck with blows, sounded like the beat of
drums. Two or three towns, not many days&rsquo; journey from Macan,
were swallowed up by the earth with their people and buildings. And
even now in another town, not far from there, they say that serpents
are coming out of the sea&mdash;very large and hideous, with
horns&mdash;and with their assault they overthrow the buildings and
houses, and slay the people; and that returning to the water they again
come out, make a capture, and immediately return to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the above-mentioned news from Japon concerning our
religious, the said father Fray Antonio, while drawing up authentic
information on behalf of our order, writes in his letter the following
paragraph:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1637, they also say, there were in Japon some
three or four religious of the Order of St. Francis who traveled
through that country to the remotest regions of the kingdom on the far
north, to a province of the said kingdom of Japan called <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>Canga.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1350src" href=
"#xd21e1350" name="xd21e1350src">3</a> It is said that the emperor
commanded that the tono, or petty king, of that province be notified
that he should be most vigilant and careful that no Christian whatever
should enter his lands; and that he responded to the emperor that quiet
reigned in his territory, and that there was no necessity to treat his
vassals harshly. This petty king, they say, is an uncle or relative of
the true king of Japon, who has disappeared.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1353src" href="#xd21e1353" name="xd21e1353src">4</a> This I saw
in one of the relations written by the Portuguese there in
Japon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have just completed the official statements regarding our martyrs,
and have finished transcribing them; two copies of them I send now, the
other I will carry or send to your Lordship. The martyrs of whom this
report is made are: Fray Luys Gomez, Fray Gabriel, Fray Juan Torrilla,
Fray Gines de Quesada, and Fray Geronimo de la Cruz&mdash;who is that
Japanese priest who, when I came from Spain, was in that church of the
Japanese (in our war of Dilao<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1361src" href=
"#xd21e1361" name="xd21e1361src">5</a>) at the side of, or a little
behind the well. The holy Fray Luys Gomez is one of those who in former
years were summoned by the emperor in order to question them about our
holy faith; he was eighty-four years of age and had spent forty in
Japon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>He died hanged in a cave, head down, with two
Japanese helpers [<i>dogicos</i>], in company with Father Sebastian
Viera, and four other native helpers of theirs. In the official account
which the Society drew up about their father, our Fray Luys is also
included. The holy Fray Gabriel de la Madalena, or Fonseca, after
having suffered the torture of hot water was burned alive, in company
with Fray Geronimo, a Japanese, in the little cottage of the latter, on
the third of September, 1632; Fray Luis, on the sixth of June, 1634.
Marvelous things, enough to fill a large book are related of Fray
Gabriel. It is common knowledge that when he prayed he was many times
raised above the ground, and that he often disappeared for a time from
the eyes of those present. From various small herbs that he gathered he
made medicines, with which he wrought miraculous cures. While he was
being burned, they say, he rose in the air two cubits [<i>codos</i>],
and while praying in the mountains this was an ordinary occurrence.</p>
<p>Besides the conversions in China and Japon, the Lord has revealed,
through the medium of his servants the sons of our father Saint
Francis, another and by no means small multitude of people who desire
with all sincerity to receive holy baptism, and to attain the knowledge
of the truth&mdash;regarding whom the governor of Terrenate already
mentioned says, in the following paragraph taken from one of his
letters: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=

"#xd21e1386" name="xd21e1386src">7</a> states, in a letter which he has
written to me, that there have been discovered more than fifty
villages, large and small; that the people are numerous, for, counting
men, women, and children, they number more than fifteen thousand. In
this estimate he falls short, for the Spaniards who are there have told
me that there are more than a hundred thousand souls, who desire to be
Christians. In this connection I wrote to the governor last year, but
his Lordship did not answer me in regard to this, nor about many things
which I have written concerning the government. Reverend Father, for
the love of God, agitate this with the governor, and send religious.
The soil is fertile, the people are extremely industrious, of stout
build, and white. Rice and other grains abound. I am now sending a
champan with twelve Spaniards, and a religious of the order to
accompany and aid Father Juan Iran&ccedil;o. The latter sent thirteen
or fourteen Indian chiefs of Manados, in order that they might return
to him as Christians; they were baptized in this convent of San
Antonio, and are now returning in this champan. They made a great feast
on the day when they were baptized, dressing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>themselves with their shirts arranged after the
Spanish fashion. All this, and the conversion of Manados and Tabuca,
have been very fully described by father Fray Francisco Chavarria and
the other religious who are here and in Manados and Tacuba, to whom I
refer as being religious of exemplary life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a summary of the information from here, concerning the
conversions as well as the state of these islands. May God our Lord
dispose all things as best pleases Him, for His greater glory and for
the good of all Christianity.</p>
<p>(Transcribed from the original letter in Ciudad de los Angeles
[<i>i.e.</i>, Puebla de los Angeles, in Mexico].)</p>
<p>All this country has been afflicted, not only by the great drouth
that prevails&mdash;for there has been no rain for eight months, which
occasions excessive heat; and the rice, the usual food in this country,
cannot be sown, and a great famine is feared&mdash;but because four
Dutch ships are in the passage through which comes the succor from
Mexico, the soldiers, silver, and other supplies; and as news [of the
galleon] did not come, some misfortune was feared. But on the
thirteenth of July God was pleased that it should make port in safety,
leaving the Dutchmen hoaxed; it did not arrive at the port of Cavite,
but at another, at a distance of three days&rsquo; journey by land, and
it could not reach Cavite until September. With the ship came the news
of the revolutions in Portugal and Catalu&ntilde;a, a very unfortunate
and dangerous affair. The Portuguese who were here from Macan went to
the governor, and on the part of that city rendered anew obedience to
King Filipo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>Fourth (whom may God preserve). They declared
that in no event would they accept the Portuguese revolt, and that, in
case India joined the said rebellion, they would always desire to
remain under the protection of Castilla; and documents to this effect
were drawn up in due form. May God be pleased to quiet those great
tumults, and give peace to Christian people!</p>
<p>The usual enemy from Mindanao, Burney, Jolo, and Camucon, did not
inflict any damage on the islands this year, because they did not sally
out in force; but much trouble is feared for the coming year, on which
account negotiations for peace are being conducted with the Mindanaos.
For, although we have four forts in that island, it is so large that
its people go out to plunder without our being able to stop them
entirely. Jol&oacute; is now at peace, for which much aid was rendered
by Father Francisco Colin, provincial of the Society, who went to visit
those islands; but I do not know whether the peace will last. The
Christian villages of Mindanao and Jolo are very gradually being
brought to a peaceable condition; and as those people are devoted Moors
[<i>i.e.</i>, Mahometans], the gospel makes little headway among them.
Nevertheless, there are some conversions all the time; and at least the
children will be good Christians. [Here follow reports of the news from
the other countries named in the title.] This is a summary of the
matters of which I have present information. Manila, July 25,

<h2 class="main">DECREE REGARDING THE INDIANS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The King. To Don Sevastian Hurtado de Corcuera, knight
of the Order of Alcantara, my governor and captain-general of the
Filipinas Islands, and president of my royal Audiencia therein: I
commanded the issue of a decree of the following tenor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King. To Don Sevastian Hurtado de Corcuera [here follow
his titles as above], or to the person or persons in whose charge the
government may be: it has been noticed in my royal Council of the
Yndias that the Indian natives of the province of Pampanga, those of
Camarines, and the Tag&aacute;logs have rendered service, and still do
so, with much affection and loyalty, ever since they were first
conquered, without any of them having rebelled; that they serve in war
together with the Spaniards, with extraordinary vigilance; and that
they likewise serve in that city [<i>i.e.</i>, Manila] as oarsmen and
pioneers, on all occasions when armed fleets are equipped, with both
their persons and their property&mdash;especially the Pampangos and the
Tag&aacute;logs. And because it is just that they should know how much
I value their fidelity and watchfulness, I have thought best to ordain
and command to you (as I do) that, since these things are so, you shall
be especially mindful of the said Indians of the three provinces above
mentioned, and give them much encouragement, for this purpose summoning
their chief men&mdash;in order that they may always continue to serve
me with the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>zeal, fidelity, and affection as they have
hitherto displayed. Dated at Madrid on the fifteenth of July in the
year one thousand six hundred and thirty-six.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">I the King</span></p>
<p>By command of the king our sovereign: <span class="sc">Don Gabriel
de Oca&ntilde;a y Alarcon</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now on the part of Don Juan Grau y Monfalcon, permanent
procurator-general for that city of Manila, he has reminded me that by
the decree here inserted I commanded that you should summon the headmen
of the Indian natives of those islands, and in my royal name thank them
for the willingness with which they have always aided my royal service,
as is more fully set forth in the said decree; and that more than ten
thousand of them served me on the occasion of the Sangley insurrection,
with much valor and good-will, seconding the citizens of that city. He
declares that they deserve that I should reward them, in order to
encourage them to continue their service when occasion shall offer; and
entreats that I will be pleased to command the issue of a decree giving
them much praise, since it is very desirable to give them prompt
encouragement, that they may also serve and conduct themselves with so
great loyalty and faithfulness in other so pressing emergencies. He
asks that you will relieve them, and exempt them from some of the many
burdens that they carry; for thus they will be encouraged to render me
service. The matter having been discussed in my royal Council of the
Yndias, considering how just it is to honor, favor, and reward them, in
order that they may render greater and more willing obedience to all
that shall be ordered to them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>for my service, I command
that you immediately summon the headmen of the Indians, and make known
to them in my behalf the esteem that I have for them personally for the
courage, affection, and good-will with which they have rendered
assistance when emergencies have arisen, and especially in the Sangley
insurrection, by which I consider myself well served. You shall give
them thanks for this, and favor and reward them in all possible ways,
endeavoring to secure their relief, convenience, and comfort. Such is
my will; and I shall especially appreciate all that you shall
accomplish for their relief and honor. Dated at &Ccedil;arago&ccedil;a,

<h2 class="main">FORMOSA LOST TO SPAIN</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first"><i>Brief relation of the loss of the island of
Hermosa; of the strength and puissance which the Dutch enemy now has in
those parts of Yndia; and of his designs and intentions after having
made peace with the Portuguese, and having therefore ceased to wage war
against them in those regions of Yndia.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is well known that it is the great desire of the
Dutch enemy, which he has always had, to make himself master of Yndia
and its riches, in order with these to continue and push forward his
revolt [against Spain], and to encourage attacks against the armies of
the king our sovereign&mdash;who so justly wages war against the Dutch,
in order to bring down their arrogance and destroy their wild heresies.
These desires have been very evident, since they have set themselves to
the task, and&mdash;God permitting this for our sins&mdash;have already
seized much territory in Yndia; and hardly is there a coast in that
country where they have not settled and fortified themselves, enjoying
its riches. In especial, they have now, in recent years, seized the
city of Malaca, a port and passage that is necessary and very useful
for going from Yndia to Great China and Japon; and in Ceilan
[<i>i.e.</i>, Ceylon] they captured a stronghold called Punta de Gali,
and, near the bar of Goa, a carrack (a large galleon) which was coming
from the kingdom of Portugal, despatched after the insurrection.
Besides this, they seized near the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>bar a patache which
was coming from Macao with ivory, and two hundred cates of gold, and
other rich goods; and now they actually occupy a post near Goa, and are
expecting to make themselves masters of all Yndia (unless our Lord
shall intercept their designs), by means of this unstable peace which
they have now made with the Portuguese. It is very plain that such is
the case; for when the order came from Holanda to the Dutch to
establish peace with the Portuguese, the former replied to the
captain-general and those of his council to the Prince of Orange, and
to the Company, saying that peace was not expedient for them in Yndia,
because affairs were in such condition that they were confident that
Yndia could be conquered within four years. Thereupon, reply was sent
to them that, notwithstanding this argument, they should negotiate the
said peace, because that was expedient at this time for the liberty of
their native land&mdash;since, the king of Espa&ntilde;a having his
attention thus diverted in Portugal, the Dutch could find therein the
opportunity to set their country free.</p>
<p>And not only has this their insatiable and lawless desire extended
to making themselves masters of Yndia, as has been already stated, but
they are eager to gain possession of what belongs to the crown of
Castilla&mdash;the city of Manila, Terrenate, Hermosa Island, and other
places&mdash;in order that thus they may remain alone and more free to
enjoy the produce and benefit of all the islands and kingdoms of those
regions. The truth of this is made evident by their frequently coming
to Manila with many galleons&mdash;twenty-two, twenty-four, or
twenty-five; but they did not succeed very well there. On that account,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>and because they recognized that our strength
was considerable, and since they were occupied in Yndia against the
Portuguese, they withdrew for several years, and returned no more to
Manila until now. At present they have become fat on the labor of
others, and are disengaged in Yndia; and, knowing well that Manila has
not much strength, they intend to wage a very grievous war, carrying it
on by weakening our forces, in order thus more safely to make
themselves masters of the city and possess its wealth&mdash;which, they
say with much glee, is very great. With this object, they have come to
the Embocadero, during the last two years of 41 and 42, to await the
ships which come from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. In this year of 43 they were
going again to the same place, with more ships and forces, and with
much caution; but, if they are not able to capture the galleons, they
will try to burn them with their own old ships, which they take with
them for this purpose. Moreover, this year they are going to try to
intercept the succor to Terrenate; and last year they seized the island
of Hermosa with a strong force, almost all [the posts] at one time.
This was something almost incredible to those who have seen their
strength and power in recent times; and it was all done with the object
of afterward attacking Manila with the aid of the Sangleys&mdash;with
whom, as I was told by a trustworthy person in Jacatra, the Dutch had
secret negotiations for an assault on Manila. This is so certain that
afterward, while I was in the kingdom of Malaca, visiting the king, a
letter came to him from the Dutch. It was written in the Portuguese
language, and he caused it to be read in my presence and that of some
Castilians and Portuguese <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>who were there. After complaining
of the king because he had aided the people of Amboino, the Dutch said
in this letter that they had already taken the island of Hermosa from
the Castilians; and that in a short time they would drive the latter
from Maluco and the Manilas ([their name] for the Filipinas
Islands).</p>

from a Dutch MS. of 1662 in Dalrymple&rsquo;s <i>Charts</i> ([London],

<p class="first">[<i>From copy in Library of Congress</i>]</p>
</div>
<p>Commencing, then, our relation, and first as regards the loss of
Hermosa Island, I say that it was and is a certain and notorious fact
that the Dutch enemy, carried away by his evil desire and damnable
intentions (as at the beginning has been stated), attacked Hermosa
Island about September in the past year of 1641;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1485src" href="#xd21e1485" name="xd21e1485src">1</a> and, not
being able to capture it, since God had blinded and hindered him,
remained more obstinate and hardened in his first object and
pretension. Accordingly, he desisted only until the following year,
1642, and about August he returned with a stronger force&mdash;so large
a one that with it he could overcome ours; and so he seized the island,
and made himself master of it, which occurred thus.</p>
<p>Having obtained a foothold, the said Dutch enemy spent part of April
and almost all of May in that year, with two champans and a round
sailing vessel called &ldquo;filipote&rdquo; [<i>i.e.</i>, flyboat],
near the headland which they call Punta del Diablo, in sight of our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>forts,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1504src" href=
"#xd21e1504" name="xd21e1504src">2</a> awaiting the succor which about
that time was to come from Manila. They retired to the river of
Tan-Chuy, with a prize which they made there, a small champan from
China, which came from that kingdom to Hermosa Island to carry supplies
and merchandise; in it was traveling a religious of St. Dominic, in the
garb of a Sangley. With this prize, and for another reason, that a
sharp north wind suddenly arose, they retired, as I have said, to
Tan-Chuy. Just at this time came the succor which the governor of
Manila was sending; this ship, arriving at the cape called Santa
Catalina, received news that the enemy was expecting it. On this
account, our people took refuge in the port of San Lorenzo, as they
carried orders from Manila to do so, in case they encountered enemies.
They remained there seven or eight days, until, having received
information from the island that the enemy had gone away, they left
that port, and pursuing their voyage, entered our harbor and fort.</p>
<p>Afterward (but not until the thirteenth of the month of August), one
afternoon at nightfall there arrived at our port a little champan, so
small that it made the Spaniards wonder at it when they saw it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>approach. This vessel came, despatched in all
haste, from the island that they call Isla de Pescadores, which is
twelve leguas from the Dutch fort. In that island is an excellent
harbor, in which the great galleons of the Dutch anchor, because they
cannot make an entrance at their forts on account of the shallow water
there. The little champan came for the sole purpose of warning an
infidel Sangley named Gui-nu&mdash;who was captain of a champan that
had arrived not long before from Manila, to get wheat and cloth to
carry to that city&mdash;that the Dutch were ready to attack Hermosa
Island within four or five days. For this they had five ships, with
five hundred Dutchmen, and large supplies of provisions, besides other
ships which had not yet arrived; accordingly, word was sent to Gui-nu
to leave our port at once. He who wrote and sent the despatch, who was
a friend of the said Sangley, told him further to go away at all
events, since the enemy was coming, not as in the previous year, but
with a much greater force; and therefore it seemed to the writer that
the Dutch would seize the island without fail.</p>
<p>With news so reliable as this, and with the information obtained
from the Indians, the governor was persuaded of its truth, and that the
enemy was returning with the strength and force that was stated;
besides, he had heard of it in letters from Manila. Accordingly he
immediately took measures to put himself in as good a state of defense
as possible. As he was warned by Indians from the river of Tan-Chuy
that this year the enemy would come from the east side, where there is
a low sand-bank which extends from the sea to the harbor, and on it is
a fort or small tower, not very strong, he ordered two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>pieces of artillery to be placed on an eminence
which commands the said tower. While they were finishing this
fortification, on the nineteenth of the month of August, the armada of
the enemy appeared in sight. This was composed of four large ships, a
patache, a large champan, and a flyboat; and besides all these vessels
there were four other ships which had not arrived. Each vessel trailed
two faluas astern, besides other and smaller boats which they carried
for landing their men. On that day when the enemy appeared, about
twelve or one o&rsquo;clock, they stood inshore with the largest ship
and the patache, making for the eminence to which our men had retired;
but they tried to protect themselves from our artillery behind a small
hill that stood there, in order thus to land their men more easily and
safely. But as they could not shelter themselves as fully as they
wished, on account of the currents which drove the ships beyond the
hill, the artillery of our stronghold (the commander of which was Don
Martin de Arechaga) compelled the enemy to retire to the sea&mdash;the
chief pilot of their ship and other men having been killed, as the
Dutch afterward told us. The ship being pierced with three or four
cannon-balls, they retreated; on seeing this, the governor sent what
men he could spare to the lookout station.</p>
<p>That night the enemy remained at anchor in the place to which they
had retreated, until the morning of the next day. Then, having held a
council, they set sail, and all five of their sailing-vessels directed
their course toward the low sand-bank I have mentioned, which is at the
eastern side of the island, in order to attempt a landing there, as we
had already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>been informed. But the flagship, on approaching
and reconnoitering the narrow entrance, saw that it had a new defense
and guard in the tower below. The commander of this tower, who was
Alf&eacute;rez Diego Felipe, commanded that a cannon-shot be fired; the
enemy, seeing by this that they were recognized and their designs
forestalled, and that now they could not gain any advantage there,
turned the flagship back toward the sea, where the rest of the ships
were waiting for it. Having reached their station, the Dutch commander
called another council of the leaders and captains; the upshot of this
was, that, considering that their antagonists there were already on the
defensive, they should make an attack at once, come what might, as they
knew very well, through the Sangleys, how many men we had. For even if
they lost many of their own men they were not in absolute need of so
many [as they had], and they might kill our men with but little loss;
and, the lookout once gained, all would be theirs, for they would have
such an advantage over us that they could always injure us, without our
being able to harm them.</p>
<p>Their consultation being concluded about one o&rsquo;clock, they
forthwith proceeded to take men with the faluas from two of the ships,
which remained with a few men, and with the champan and the flyboat, to
guard the entrances to the harbor; and the three other ships, with many
small boats which they carried for this purpose, approached near the
land, behind the shelter of the hill, where they would be entirely out
of the range of the artillery in our stronghold. Having cast anchor
there, they proceeded to send ashore their soldiers with the faluas
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>and small boats, landing them at the edge of the
sea, because they feared some of our musketeers who were on land. On
this account, having embarked the men [in the boats], they rowed
rapidly toward the shore, and meanwhile kept the field clear, from the
ships, with their artillery and musketry, while their trumpets sounded
the attack. Thus they came to land, where our men awaited
them&mdash;twelve of our Spanish soldiers, eight Pampangos, and thirty
or forty Indian natives [<i>i.e.</i>, of Formosa] who were bowmen. The
governor had resolved to send this number of men into the field, and no
more, for he suspected that the enemy would attempt to land more troops
in another place. Our men made a brave stand, and went down to the
shore, and killed many of the enemy as they landed, on account of the
latter coming, as they did, so crowded together in their boats. Thus
our men fired their guns at a crowd, and some used three balls at one
shot; and the Indian bowmen, who were very skilful, also inflicted much
damage on the Dutch, all the more as they came boldly on. They followed
out their design until they landed their men; and then, as they were
numerous and our men few, they steadily gained the upper hand and
wounded some of our soldiers. Thereupon the latter began to retreat
slowly, three of their men being seriously wounded&mdash;one of whom
remained on the field, where he soon died; the two others made their
way as best they could to the fort, where one died and the other
recovered.</p>
<p>Thus the enemy proceeded to ascend the slope until they succeeded in
obtaining possession of the lookout and the height, where they
immediately stationed more than three hundred white men; this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>gave opportunity for the rest of their men, five
hundred more, to disembark and come to land. Then they set up their
tents, in a place where they could store much food, and immediately
sent ashore all their supplies, on the side from which it could not be
seen from our forts. Afterward they also sent ashore much artillery and
a mortar; of these pieces they carried two to the lookout
station&mdash;cannons of eight and ten pound balls&mdash;and with other
small pieces with which they bombarded us, not only in the stronghold,
but in the great fort below. Their balls reached everything, on all
sides, and everything was visible and uncovered from the lookout
station; this was very evident, since a cannon-ball [struck] the
parapet of the fosse belonging to the great fort, and passed on,
carrying away a stone from the cavalier of San Sebastian in the same
fort.</p>
<p>Affairs being now in the said condition, we continued to make ready
our retirade,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1548src" href="#xd21e1548"
name="xd21e1548src">3</a> and were expecting that the enemy would begin
with baskets [<i>i.e.</i>, filled with earth] or would be fortified in
some other manner in order to make an assault; but this did not occur,
as they made no fort at the lookout, which would rise above the land
about. However, on the side next the sea they made on the mountain a
large esplanade, from which they fired the cannons; and, this done,
they opened in the mountain itself two mouths, as it were, in the shape
of trenches, through which they brought the cannons to bear, and
bombarded us openly, while from our retirade <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>we
could not discover their men or more than barely see the mouths of the
cannon in their artillery.</p>
<p>After this manner the war lasted five days, until the day of the
glorious apostle St. Bartholomew, the twenty-fourth of August, when
they bombarded and overthrew the wall of our retirade&mdash;which we
had finished building, but it was not finished inside, nor did it
contain any lodgings. As the Dutchmen afterward said, they fired that
day, with the two cannon and from the fleet, one hundred and eight
times; it was so arranged that while the cannon were being loaded there
was no cessation of firing from all the musketry&mdash;which they had
stationed at the top of the lookout, in files, directing the men to
shelter themselves behind the hill, and to load their muskets while the
artillery was at work. This they did so incessantly that it seemed to
be the Judgment Day; and they gave no respite to our men, who were few
in number and worn out with fatigue.</p>
<p>The wall being now thrown down, and many men being slain&mdash;among
them Alf&eacute;rez Juan de Valdes, a very valiant soldier&mdash;and
many others wounded, and the rest of the troops being exhausted with
the incessant fighting for five days and nights, and a palisade which
we occupied having been broken into with iron bars: the enemy formed
four troops for assaulting the retirade. This they did, and entered
without ladders, since the walls were thrown down, as I said. This
being perceived from above by our men, some of these, of the baser
sort, fled through the gate; while others leaped over the wall, on the
side next our fort, which they succeeded in reaching. Others who were
above with Captain Valentin de Arechaga, fighting with the enemies,
and, as they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>say, retreating, drove the enemy back on their
haunches; and thence they retreated to the fort below. Two others,
Spanish boys, hid themselves&mdash;one in the powder-house, the other
in a water-tank; the enemy slew the former, thinking that he intended
to set fire to the powder, and the other they took captive.</p>
<p>Being now masters of the retirade, they trained a cannon from it
(for they had no other left), mounted, against our men; and at the same
time they sent a white flag with one of their men, demanding that,
since they now held all the place as their own, we should surrender,
since there was still opportunity to escape with our lives. He said
that if we did not yield there would be no advantage for us in doing
so, and there would be nothing to expect but death. The governor
received this envoy, for he saw that what they said was true, and that
we had no hope or refuge in the world, nor could even hope to delay the
catastrophe; and he considered that by not accepting their proposal he
was exposing to death more than four hundred innocent
souls&mdash;children, women, servants, roadmakers, and
soldiers&mdash;and that the soldiers did not amount to forty effective
men. He saw that there was no hope of doing more than to die for the
sake of dying; but if relief could be hoped for by any means, or he
could see any indication that they could resist the enemy, he and his
men were all determined to die rather than yield up anything of their
rights. But he concluded that they were able to resist no longer, as I
have said; and considered that any one who understood the occasion
well, and who knew the opportunity and advantage and superior strength
that the enemy had, and what our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>men had done in every way,
would not rashly condemn his course. For in order to form a proper
judgment of anything, to see it and be on the spot is very different
from hearing it afar, and, as they say, talking from behind the
palings. The governor replied to him who came to offer this settlement
that he would consult his officers as to what ought to be done and what
should seem most expedient; and that afterward he would return answer
in accordance with such decision. Thereupon the bearer of the white
flag went away, and the governor placed the matter before his followers
and the religious who were there. It seemed to all that, considering
that the enemy had now demolished and gained the retirade and the
eminence, which was the mainstay and guard of the fort below, and that
now without any doubt the fort was practically in their
possession&mdash;[which they could accomplish] without the loss of a
single man, but with the death of all our people; without need for
attacking us, but simply by driving us out&mdash;the best possible
terms ought to be secured, and that accordingly we should surrender.
For [they considered that, to justify] exposing all those people to
death there must be some hope [of success or relief], of which there
was none at that time. Nor were they ignorant of the requirements of
military honor and usage, but these passed sentence [upon surrender]
when the enemy were not so sure of victory, and when they themselves
had some grounds for hope; but without such hope neither did God, nor
consequently human law, hold them under such rigorous obligation; and
one law states that no one is obliged to do what is impossible.</p>
<p>The conference being concluded, answer was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>made
to the enemy in conformity with the above decision. When they came to
the terms of surrender, our men stipulated that they should leave the
fort with their arms, flags flying, drums [beating], guns loaded, and
matches lighted. At first the enemy refused this, being willing only to
spare our lives; for they saw very plainly that everything was in their
power, and that what they were giving was only a favor. They were not
willing to give us the vessels that we asked from them, but said that
we all must go to Tay-Chuan, their fort; and that if the governor of
that place had orders he would give us boats. If he did not, they said
that we must voyage to Jacatra, to see the commander-in-chief,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1573src" href="#xd21e1573" name="xd21e1573src">4</a>
and that he would give us transportation; for they themselves carried
no orders for anything else [than the seizure of the island]. With this
the affair was ended&mdash;which is the truth of the matter, without
any pretense or cloak.</p>
<p>Having departed from the fort with the said terms they placed us all
in the convents of St. Domingo and St. Francis, with guards, while they
arranged their affairs; then they sent us to Tay-quan, a fort of theirs
on the other side. At the convents, the Dutch proceeded to take from
all our men their weapons and flags, on the pretext that they must
embark the Spaniards without these, for fear of some mutiny or
uprising. This was afterward told to the commander-in-chief at Jacatra
[<i>now</i> Batavia], and he replied that the guns and flags had been
left at Tay-quan; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>but that if the governor of that place, who
was coming by March or April, should bring them [to Jacatra], he would
give them up. On this account the [Spanish] governor remained at
Jacatra to await them, and to send away his men, and to be the last
one. There was great danger that some men would remain there, by their
own choice; or that, urged by the Dutch, they would say that they
preferred to remain. The Pampangos and Cagayans remained with the
Dutch, who refused to give them to us, although they had granted
liberty to all [of our men]. Although many remonstrances were made to
them on this point, they replied that they would pay those Indians as
the Spaniards had done, and that the former should serve them.
Accordingly, some of the Indians remained in Tay-quan, and the rest
were taken by the Dutch in their ships that were going against Amboino
and Terrenate. Some free servants were seized by certain Dutchmen in
Tay-quan and in Hermosa Island, who refused to give them back; and
afterward we learned that they had sold these servants to some of their
countrymen. When this was told to the commander-in-chief, he said that
it could not be true, and that he would make them give back all who
remained in Tay-quan, twelve in number. The affair remained thus,
unsettled, a matter which is certainly worthy of consideration; and it
is sufficient cause for keeping back, whenever opportunity offers, some
of their men until they return to us all those free and Christian
people, who remain with them at the risk of losing the faith.</p>
<p>From the convents where they had kept us, they embarked us in four
ships to convey us to the fortress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147"
href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>of Tay-quan; and at the same
time six companies of the Dutch who remained in our forts set out by
land to go to the province of Torboan, in the eastern part of the
island, to find the gold mines that the natives possess there. The
latter obtain some gold from the sands of a river, of which fact the
Dutch were informed; and this was a powerful motive for their seizing
our forts. In order to carry out their purpose to search for gold
mines, they came provided with men who were skilled in such work. This
expedition marched until they reached the village of Santiago, eight
leguas of the journey, [where they were stopped] by some precipices;
they turned back, as they were not able to go any farther on account of
the bad weather and roads, and as their provisions gave
out&mdash;difficulties which, it seemed, they could ill overcome. But,
although they could make no farther progress, they sent men with a
champan to examine and reconnoitre the port of San Lorenzo, of which
some inconsiderate person, or the Indians, had informed them; and they
explored it very thoroughly.</p>
<p>The commander returned to the island with the said six companies,
and hanged six Indians of the natives of Hermosa Island, from the three
villages friendly to us&mdash;Santiago, Guimarri, and
Taparri&mdash;because they had not supplied the Dutch with food, nor
gone with them, nor guided them as the Dutch wished, the natives having
promised to do so, although through fear. The enemy were unmindful
that, since the Indians were our friends, they usually act thus, as it
is their nature. The Dutch also hanged another, a Tag&aacute;log boy,
who served their commander, because he ran away to the natives of that
country; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>and two Dutchmen whom they found in our
garrison, in the pay of his Majesty. These things, and the knowledge
that the Indians have of them, have had such an effect on the latter
that whenever they can they will break the heads of the Dutchmen, and
will not accept their friendship. On the contrary, they now deplore our
absence, and in the shadow of the Dutchmen the Spaniards are now almost
saints; and the natives only ask when the Spaniards will return.</p>
<p>They immediately fortified themselves on the river of Tanchuy, where
they erected a fort of logs, in the same place where our fort was first
built, and left their artillery and sixty soldiers&mdash;as afterward
we were told by some of our roadmakers whom they carried there to work.
All this was to make them masters of the trade&mdash;in sulphur,
rattan, pelts, and many other products that are found along that river
and in its vicinity. They also built at once a fort of stone, although
without lime, on the highest point of the island where our forts were,
the lookout station by which they won the retirade from us.</p>
<p>Finally, while our men were voyaging to their forts of Tay-quan, we
encountered the four other ships that were going to them with succor,
and with these came the general and leader of them all, who had been
unable to arrive before.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1598src" href=
"#xd21e1598" name="xd21e1598src">5</a> He went to our island, and began
to govern it and direct its affairs; and it was he who went to look for
gold, and who hanged the said Indians, and built a fort at Tanchuy. He
despatched four ships to the coasts and <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1601" title="Source: routs">routes</span> of Japon, in order that
they might attack the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>champans of the Sangleys who might
go to trade in that empire; for the Dutch say that those traders go
without chapa (or license) from their king. In Tay-quan they detained
some of our men a month and a half, or more; others they immediately
sent away, with our governor, in the first ship that sailed to Jacatra;
and afterward, at the end of October, those who remained in Tay-quan
went in four other ships.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1606src" href=
"#xd21e1606" name="xd21e1606src">6</a> Having thus sent all our men to
Jacatra, the Dutch again undertook an expedition to discover the gold
mines at Torboan; and they actually set out with a large force of men
in November, which is a rainy season in the Tay-quan region. On this
account, and because it is nearer, they crossed by land the middle
ridge which Hermosa Island has, from Tay-quan to Torboan; but, as we
afterward learned in Jacatra from the people on the other ship (which
sailed later from Tay-quan), they did not reach the river of gold, on
account of the great ruggedness of the mountains, and the bad weather
which through November and December prevails in the Torboan region.
Therefore they only punished some villages which lay nearer; and they
burned these because, years before, the natives had killed a [Dutch]
factor. With this they returned, leaving that expedition for the
spring-time; this will cost them much hardship and perhaps many lives,
for there is great difficulty in both the entrance and the ascent; and
the Indians who are now among them will have changed their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>settlements, and will make great resistance to
them&mdash;and will do so quite safely&mdash;since in the mountains
they are very dextrous and experienced, and the Dutch clumsy.</p>
<p>It is certain that if they do not succeed in the search for gold
they will abandon our forts, retaining only that of Tan-chuy on account
of that river and its trade, as some of them said&mdash;since for their
trade with the Chinese and Japanese they occupy Tay-quan. That region
is a very pleasant one, with a good climate; and they have very good
fortifications, dwellings, and storehouses for their goods. They have
spent there more than one hundred thousand pesos, as one of them told
me; and there they possess a considerable trade and commerce with the
Chinese. Through this, they learn by means of the Chinese all that
passes in Manila and its provinces; for after the latter have sold to
the Dutchmen, at the proper time, what they need and what they have to
send to Jacatra, the Sangleys are occupied during the rest of the year
in bringing from China cloth and other commodities which find a market
in Manila and Pangasinan; [they bring these to Tay-quan] in small
champans, and immediately lade some large ones which they keep at
Tay-quan, and sail for Manila. Besides this, the reason why the Dutch
have made so great efforts to capture Hermosa Island, going to attack
it year after year, was that they had promised the Japanese that they
would do so, and would expel the Spaniards from it. I was told this by
a religious who was in the kingdom of Tonquin&mdash;where, he said,
this was related to him by a Christian from Antuerpia, who was in the
service of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>Society [of Jesus]; and this occurred even
before the island was taken.</p>
<p>As for the second [topic], the power which the Dutch enemy possess
in those regions, which is greater than we could imagine of them:
According to what I myself have seen, and what trustworthy and reliable
persons who have traded have told me, the Dutch have at this time more
than one hundred and fifty ships and pataches, at a moderate
estimate&mdash;all equipped and provided with seamen, soldiers,
artillery, and other necessary supplies. And they are under such
discipline that even when they are in the port of Jacatra&mdash;as I
saw, and was well informed thereon&mdash;every ship keeps its people on
board, so that no one may go ashore without special permission; and
when they come from any voyage, before entering the port, all engage in
repairing and cleaning and calking their ships. As a result, when they
reach their anchorage in the port they can immediately, without delay,
again go forth and make a voyage, save when some ship needs unusual
repairing; in short, all their men serve as if they were servants
receiving wages.</p>
<p>In Tay-quan, during the months of September and October, 1642, there
were seventeen ships and a patache, all belonging to the enemy. Of
these, nine had come to Jacatra for the capture of Hermosa Island, four
of them having first remained in the Embocadero of Manila, waiting for
our ships from Castilla. Four others had come from Japon, and the rest
were held in reserve at Tay-quan. Of these seventeen ships, five went
to carry our people to Jacatra, and were laden with sugar and preserved
ginger for Holanda; iron or steel from Japan; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>loaves of sulphur; and stuffs, silver, and other
merchandise. Four other ships departed to seize the champans of Chinese
who were coming from Japon; and the eight vessels that were left
remained in Tay-quan, in order that their men might go to search for
the gold that was reported to exist in Torboan. This last-named fleet
was to sail afterward (by February of 1643) from Tay-quan, with the
governor of that place, to Jacatra; and on the way they were to inflict
punishment on the king of Cochinchina for the death of some Dutchmen
who were wrecked on that coast, in two ships.</p>
<p>Besides the said ships, we found when we arrived at Jacatra more
than twenty others, very well equipped with supplies and artillery; and
more than thirty or forty cannon, which I myself counted there. Besides
all these vessels another was there, the great three-decked carrack or
galleon from Yndia, which the Dutch had captured from the Portuguese at
the bar of Goa. Five other ships had sailed a few days before for
Malaca, and these were met by the vessels that were carrying our people
from Tay-quan. Six others were then blockading the bar of Goa; but on
account of the treaty of peace, the Dutch have ordered these to
withdraw, and as yet these have not come back. [Still another squadron
of] five vessels well equipped was sent at the beginning of November,
1642, to Terrenate, to await the relief ship from Manila; and with them
was another ship, which they keep in reserve at the fort of Malayo.
They will wait there until the end of April, or May, until the arrival
of thirty-two other ships, which were besieging Amboino, with more than
fifteen hundred men; and all together will go to attack Terrenate.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>For this purpose they took from Jacatra, in
December, 1642, great quantities of supplies, as was seen by myself and
by our men who came hither; and when they go to Terrenate, after making
the Amboino expedition, it will be a question whether they seize the
relief ship for Terrenate&mdash;although, perhaps, they will not
capture it at all, confident in their own power.</p>
<p>Besides the said ships, I was told by a sub-factor of the English
that the Dutch have seventeen more ships on the coasts of Yndia,
Ceilan, and Persia, and all of these are supplied from Jacatra. In this
number are not included the vessels that they send to their factories,
to each of which sail one, two, or more, according to the amount of
trade there; and their factories are so numerous that there is not any
kingdom, whether of infidels or Moors, in those regions where they have
not an establishment&mdash;Japon, Tonquin, Camboja, Siam, the kingdom
of Achen, Bantan Xambi, Mazarmasin,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1631src"
href="#xd21e1631" name="xd21e1631src">7</a> Macasar, Solor, and Amboino
(which is entirely in their power, and where there is a great quantity
of cloves, so that it is exceedingly valuable). In other regions also
they have factories and much trade; I would never end if I were to
enumerate all. Moreover, there went to Holanda this year, in December
and January, eleven large ships, which I saw, and almost every month
fresh ships arrive from that country; so that there are always ships
coming and going between Holanda and these islands.</p>
<p>Then as for the men that they have here, there is a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>large force. For, besides those who are engaged
or sail in all the ships that I have mentioned, those in the garrisons
of their forts and presidios, and the men in the six ships that were
blockading Goa, who have not yet come back, they are now sending a
large armada against Amboino and Terrenate&mdash;all the men in which
are experienced and trained soldiers, as I saw in Jacatra. Not only
this, but all the men who were engaged in the capture of Hermosa Island
remained there (where they now are), to support the pretensions of the
Dutch which I recounted above, to discover the gold mines in Torboan,
and for the punishment of Cochinchina. Besides all the said troops,
another ship arrived at Jacatra from Holanda in January, which carried
more than one hundred and fifty fresh soldiers; and this year these
Dutch have urgently requested more men from Holanda, for the purpose of
attacking Manila, now that they see an opportunity for it and that the
affairs [of Spain] are in a disturbed condition.</p>
<p>As for provisions from Holanda&mdash;biscuit, pork, beef, wine, oil,
vinegar, etc.&mdash;the amount that they have cannot be told or
imagined; for of these articles alone they have enough for two or three
years. I mention only the Castilian wine, of delicious quality, which
they consume more freely than if they were in Espa&ntilde;a; and when
they go to draw it [from the keg], they rinse the glasses with it, and
waste it; and yet this goes on without causing a scarcity of it. Then
they have storehouses full of ammunition and military supplies, an
enormous number of anchors, and stables that contain fifty war-horses,
to handle which they are well trained.</p>
<p>As for the great wealth that they have acquired: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>In
December of this year, 1642, when I was in Jacatra, they sent ten large
galleons, and another in January of 1643, all the eleven ships laden
with drugs of the highest value in Europe&mdash;such as cloves, pepper,
cinnamon&mdash;sugar, silks, precious stones, gold, and many other rich
articles. According to what they said, these ships carried goods to the
value of thirteen millions here&mdash;which, delivered in Holanda,
would amount to an incredible sum. With this wealth they wage war on us
in Flandes, in these regions, and throughout the world. On this account
we might expect that if his Majesty the king of Espa&ntilde;a would
wage war against them in this quarter, he would certainly subdue them
very soon in Flandes. For he who would cut off a great river, and stop
its flow, does not undertake to do this near the sea, where its current
is broad and deep, and it already seems like [a part of] the sea, where
such attempt will be exceedingly difficult, or even impossible; but he
goes to the beginning or origin of the stream, where the task will be
very easy for him. And so, to wage war against the Dutch in Flandes
alone is to try to cut off a river near the sea, where it has a great
flow; it is therefore almost impossible to do so by sending there more
troops and money. But if vigorous measures were taken to send four
thousand men to Filipinas, it would be very easy thus to destroy them
here, where they are so successful, and make an end of their power.</p>
<p>As for the third and last topic that I mentioned&mdash;the designs
and intentions of the Dutch enemy, now that they have made peace in
Yndia with the Portuguese: It is very important to consider this, since
they have always been eager, as I have related, to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>get
possession of Manila and its fortified places, and to drive out the
Spaniards from these regions. This was doubtful until now, when they
find themselves puissant, and disengaged from other wars; and, on the
other hand, they know that Manila has not very strong defenses, and
that it will not receive abundant aid because the affairs of
Espa&ntilde;a are so disturbed. Accordingly they will exert all their
strength to carry out these desires of theirs, as greedy as of long
standing; and this is so much the fact that, as I know perfectly well,
they talk among themselves of nothing else than how they will gain
Manila, and load themselves with silver. Therefore they have urgently
demanded troops from Holanda; and until these shall come they are
making every effort to capture the ships from Castilla, and are
actually undertaking this with a large and powerful fleet. If they
cannot capture the Spanish ships, they will try to burn them, even if
it be by burning two or more of their own; and they will take with them
some old ships for this purpose.</p>
<p>Besides this, they intend, as I have related, to take Terrenate; and
they have actually gone to those forts to deprive them of the relief
sent, with as large a force as they can send. Likewise, they will be
continually infesting and harassing the coasts of Manila and its
environs, and will not allow any ships worth mention to enter or leave
that port, and will do this, even if it causes them great expense; and
for this purpose they will be continually receiving succor&mdash;either
by way of Terrenate, in May, June, and July; or else from Hermosa
Island, from September until April&mdash;since for all this they have
extra ships, much wealth, and great energy. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>They intend, also, to seize or to obstruct the champans from China
which may go to trade at Manila; and to avail themselves secretly of
the Sangleys to cause a diversion [of the Spanish forces] in Manila at
the time when the Dutch shall attack it. All this was fully explained
to me by a religious person who was in Jacatra, and was on very
intimate terms with some of the Dutchmen, as he understood their
language and customs. The expedition against Manila would be, as they
thought, in May or in October of the year 1644; and, if at the latter
time, it would go by way of Tay-quan.</p>
<p>Among the injuries which they will meanwhile try to inflict upon us,
not the least will be an attempt to burn the galleons and our vessels
that may be in Cavite, or in other places; or corrupting through
clandestine spies whomsoever they can among our men, or effecting an
entrance at night, and by stratagem&mdash;both of which they did at
Goa. Recently they burned the galleons of the Portuguese, which lay
within the port, at anchor, and with the usual guard. With this they
tied the hands of the Portuguese, and rendered it impossible for them
to sally out and resist the Dutch. There is no doubt that they will, if
they have the opportunity, do much worse than what I have told; for
this is an astute and cautious enemy, who knows whatever occurs among
our people; and we live in anxieties. Dated in the kingdom of Macasar,
in March, 1643.</p>

<p>[To this document we append the following additional information,
obtained from Ferrando and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>Fonseca&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">Historia de los PP. Dominicos en las Islas Filipinas</i> (Madrid,
1870), ii, pp. 440&ndash;447:]</p>
<p>Governor Corcuera, who regarded with much indifference that goodly
conquest,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1670src" href="#xd21e1670" name=
"xd21e1670src">8</a> failed to recognize its importance as an advanced
and strategic point for checking the aggressions of the Dutch; and,
engaged in making new conquests which he could not preserve, he had
entirely abandoned it [<i>i.e.</i>, Formosa]. A wretched company of
invalids and raw recruits was the only force allotted for the defense
of that island against a victorious enemy, who, flushed with the
triumphs that they had obtained over the Portuguese possessions,
believed (and with some reason) that everything must give way to their
triumphal progress through these seas, [Their first attack on Tanchuy,
in 1641, is &ldquo;almost miraculously repulsed by its feeble
garrison;&rdquo; but in this expedition the Dutch learn the topography
of that region, the condition of the Spanish forts, etc., and plan anew
its conquest.] Their plans were not hidden from the commandant of the
fort, nor from our good religious, who mingled their counsels with
those of the men who were defending the cause of religion and native
land. All quickly saw the urgent necessity of re&euml;nforcing the
garrison, and of demanding fresh troops from the government at
Manila.</p>
<p>With this honorable commission finally departed from Formosa,
surrounded with a thousand perils, Father Juan de los Angeles, vicar
and superior of the Dominican fathers who had in charge the spiritual
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>administration of that island.... He gave to the
governor an account of the recent conflict; explained with deep feeling
the melancholy and precarious situation of the colony; and declared how
certainly the honor of the Spanish flag in Formosa was greatly
compromised unless effort was made as soon as possible to
re&euml;nforce its garrison. This demand was received at the time with
some appearance of interest, but it did not receive the prompt
attention which the importance of the matter demanded. The preservation
of Formosa did not interest Corcuera or his private counselors; but he
was finally forced to save appearances to some extent, in order not to
take upon himself, at all events, the scandalous responsibility of what
must unavoidably occur in such an extreme case. He actually despatched
the messenger, with a weak re&euml;nforcement, in a wretched
hulk&mdash;which, without any provision for its safety or good
condition, was miserably shipwrecked on the northern coast of Luzon, at
the first attack of a slight storm. It was possible to save,
nevertheless, the men and the outfit of the ship; and Father Angeles
was able to fit out another and safer vessel, which carried them safely
to Formosa, with the little aid sent from Manila. This consisted of
some food and military supplies, eight Spanish soldiers, and the
ship&rsquo;s crew, undisciplined and unarmed, who could only serve as a
hindrance, in any case.</p>
<p>[Tanchuy is taken from the Spaniards by the Dutch, as is related by
Father Angeles; Ferrando adds:] Forty pieces of heavy artillery fell
into their hands, with large quantities of gunpowder and military
supplies, twenty-five thousand duros from the treasury, and a great
deal of merchandise owned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>by private persons, which might
amount to nearly a million in value. This was the first disgraceful
victory which the Dutch could obtain over the Spanish arms in that
great Oceania, [and that] because the island was neglected and
abandoned by an unlucky governor&mdash;a victory that was a thousand
times more unfortunate, since it inflated their arrogance to the
extreme of believing themselves powerful enough to dispute with us at
last the envied possession of the Filipinas Islands.</p>
<p>It was the province of the most holy Rosary which felt the deepest
pain at this lamentable result; for besides [being compelled to]
abandon their beloved flocks, they lost various churches and convents,
with their precious images and sacred ornaments; the provisions
destined for the missionaries at Fo-gan; three priests and two lay
brethren, who were sent prisoners to Jacatra (now Nueva Batavia); and,
finally, their hopes of seeing in the bosom of religion and of the
Church all the inhabitants of that island, whose conversion to
Christianity had already made considerable progress. [These converts,
however, long retain the faith that they had received from the
missionaries, and shun both heathen observances and the heresies of
their Dutch conquerors.]</p>
<p>The Dutch, now masters of that Spanish island, celebrated during
eight days the signal triumph of their arms, carrying away to the fort
of Tay-quan all the Spanish soldiers and religious. From that place
they transferred these prisoners to the capital of Java, now adding to
their number the zealous Father Ch&aacute;ves,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1691src" href="#xd21e1691" name="xd21e1691src">9</a> who since
the preceding year had remained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>a prisoner in their hands.
They were not so ill received or treated in the Netherlandish colony as
they would have feared. The governor of Java was a very generous man,
and showed consideration and respect in every way to the Spanish
prisoners&mdash;our religious securing the fullest liberty to exercise
their apostolic labors, not only among the Catholics, but even among
the infidels and sectaries of those foreign possessions. At last, all
the difficulties were overcome which would naturally arise in the way
of restoring them all to Manila without exchange or ransom, or
compensation of any kind&mdash;thanks to the influence and great
prestige which our excellent missionaries were able to acquire among
even the enemies of the Catholic religion. Only the governor of Formosa
remained among the Dutch, because he feared the results of the rigorous
residencia which would be required from him in Manila for the loss of
that island, and more especially of the fortress of
Tanchuy&mdash;notwithstanding that his responsibility was freed from
blame in the consciences of all; and the most skilful leader would have
yielded, without fail, with the small and wretched garrison of that
fort. He had done quite enough; and the responsibility, in any case,
must be sought higher up....</p>
<p>The Spanish soldiers were greatly disturbed by the desertion of the
governor of Formosa. Destitute of a chief and leader to govern them,
and unable to agree on the nomination of another, they almost resolved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>to abandon the voyage; but the religious, to
whom they owed their liberty, and whose opinion they still respected,
gained their good-will anew, and induced them to consent to a
reasonable agreement&mdash;which they accepted only on condition that
father Fray Juan de los Angeles would accept the office of their
leader, which they conferred upon him by acclamation. At the command
and under the direction of the said father, they were immediately
shipped to Macasar, where the ruler of the island sent them their
rations on account, until an officer arrived from Manila with orders to
pay all their just expenses, and to conduct them at last to the capital
of Filipinas, where they arrived safe and sound on the twenty-ninth of
June in 1643. Thus the province of the most holy Rosary obtained some
consolation for that great misfortune, by receiving to its bosom four
excellent religious whom it already regarded as lost to it.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>[La Concepci&oacute;n (<i lang="es">Hist. de Philipinas</i>, vi, pp.
89&ndash;113) blames the Jesuits for the loss of
Formosa&mdash;alleging, as grounds for this, their desire to monopolize
the missions to China, to which Formosa was a stepping-stone for other
orders; and their resentment against the friars (especially the
Dominican Morales) for accusing them at Rome of undue laxity and
conformity to heathen observances (in the noted controversy over the
&ldquo;Chinese rites&rdquo;). To this end, he thinks, they exerted
their influence with Corcuera, inducing him to neglect Formosa and to
send his troops to Mindanao, where the missions were in charge of the
Jesuits.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=

<h2 class="main">LETTER FROM FELIPE IV TO CORCUERA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The King. To Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, knight
of the Order of Alcantara, my governor and captain-general of the
Filipinas Islands: In my royal Council of the Indias, and in the
military conference for those regions, some letters have been
considered which you wrote to me about various matters of government,
war, and revenue; and reply is here made to the points therein on which
a decision has been reached.</p>
<p>By a certificate which you send it appears that there has been a
saving to my royal exchequer of certain amounts of money, the proceeds
of donations that have been made of two-thirds of the year[ly dues to
persons in my service], for which satisfaction should be made to the
creditors of pay-warrants in arrears, giving them what is due them;
because my royal intention is, that what is justly due them should be
paid to them in full, without giving any opportunity for such
remissions [of debt as these]. You are duly notified that for the
future this innovation shall not be put into practice in any way, but
that every person shall be paid that which is clearly his due; and this
mode of saving has been severely censured, because it is to the injury
of the parties concerned.</p>
<p>You know how much I regard and cherish all the Indian natives of my
western Indias, and that the preservation of those provinces is
dependent on their prosperity and kind treatment. Accordingly it has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>seemed fitting to me to charge you anew with
this; and I command that you, attentive to the decrees which declare in
their favor, be very heedful of the kind treatment of those natives,
and not allow them to receive any wrong from the officials or from
other persons.</p>
<p>You say that you have appointed the chief notary of the government
to the office of judge for the usual licenses of the Sangleys, in order
that that office may by this combination not only increase in money
value, but be held in greater repute; I have approved your arrangement
to this end.</p>
<p>The archbishop of those islands has reported to me how expedient it
is that some archiepiscopal buildings should be erected in that city;
and in order to the execution of this plan I have decreed that you
shall inform me what measures and means can be employed for the
accomplishment of this work without causing expense to my royal
exchequer. You say that some donations could be accepted from the
employed seamen and mariners who sail in the ships, and that the
archbishop himself could aid by some contributions which he could
solicit in the city, since these cause no loss to me or to the vassals
who serve me in those islands. In my opinion, these measures cannot be
approved; but those who hold maritime offices should go gratuitously,
without its costing them anything; but if, after they return from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, they should choose to make some voluntary contributions
for the erection of the archiepiscopal buildings, it may be proposed to
them. It is best to proceed in this manner, gathering together what can
be obtained, and not to solicit any donations, in order that this fund
may be placed in my royal treasury. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>every case, effort
should be made that the mates of ships, the boatswains, and other
maritime officials who go to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a be the most
meritorious, and be selected from the most capable men, without asking
from them any donations. Then with the money from voluntary
contributions, or in other ways which do not cause expense to my royal
treasury, let the work of building these houses be undertaken, avoiding
all other measures which may cause embarrassment or annoyance; and you
shall act according to this plan and counsel, making such arrangements
as shall be most suitable. You shall wholly exclude donations that
shall not be voluntary, and shall not allow them to be bargained for at
any time.</p>
<p>You state that you have commanded a gallery to be made in the royal
buildings, facing the Plaza de Armas; and that by this arrangement all
the offices were accommodated, so that it was not necessary to look for
any official outside of the palace. As it has been considered that this
gallery and extension will be an advantage to the said buildings, what
you have accomplished in this is approved.</p>
<p>By a special commission from me is entrusted to Juan Bautista
Zubiaga, auditor of accounts for those islands, the collection of the
results of accounts which Don Francisco de Rozas y O&ntilde;ate, late
visitador of that Audiencia, left unsettled. And since the death of
that auditor might cause some failure in these collections, and they
might not proceed as they should, I command that you take such
precautions in this matter as I may expect from you.</p>
<p>A relief ship having sailed from those islands for Terrenate in the
year 1639 was, as you have learned, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>assailed by a
tempest, and it returned to that port, where the artillery that it
carried was lost. This occurred, as you say, in water one and a half to
two brazas in depth; and as it is certain that this artillery will be
greatly needed, you shall endeavor to have it drawn out of the water,
making every effort possible to accomplish this. I charge you to be
heedful of this matter.</p>
<p>As for what you say in regard to the purchase that Don Fray Hernando
Guerrero, the late archbishop of those islands, made of some houses
from Pedro de Heredia, to the amount of one hundred and forty pesos,
and that the fiscal of the Audiencia there demands that these houses be
added to the property of my royal crown for the same sum, and as you
judge that from the property left by that prelate the debts which he
left can be paid: it has appeared best to charge you, as I do, that you
allow the property thus left by this archbishop to follow the natural
course [of law], without making any innovation in this case. Zaragoza,
August 4, 1643.</p>

<h2 class="main">CONCESSIONS TO THE JESUITS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first salute">Sire:</p>
<p>Balthasar de Lagunilla, procurator of the Society of Jesus for the
provinces of the Western Yndias, states that Don Sevastian Hurtado de
Corcuera, governor of the Filipinas Islands&mdash;in consideration of
the fact that in the old Parian of Manila, which the Chinese burned in
the late insurrection, the Manila college of the Society of Jesus owned
a certain piece of land with some houses, the rent of which aided in
the support of the college, and considering the great poverty of the
Society&mdash;allotted to the said college a piece of land in the new
Parian, one hundred brazas long and fifty wide, in order that the
fathers might build some houses thereon, and be aided by the little
rent that they could obtain from them. The said governor also granted
that a ferry-boat which they had in the old Parian should be retained
by them in the new one, in consideration of their having lost nearly
all their property in the said insurrection; and, besides this, that
the Sangleys who might reside in the village of Santa Cruz&mdash;the
instruction and spiritual cultivation of which is in charge of the
Society&mdash;should be exempted from tribute for a certain time. All
this was granted on condition that your Majesty should be pleased to
confirm it. The matter having been discussed in the royal Council of
the Indias, they commanded the governor to send information again
regarding the favors he had done in conferring the lot in the Parian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>and the ferry-boat. On account of the facts that
these are not new favors, but the continuation of old ones (as the only
change is in the location of the land), and that nothing therein causes
the least accident or loss to the royal exchequer, nor to the
ferry-boat belonging to the hospital of Manila, since the two ferries
are quite far apart, and the bridge is midway between them&mdash;as
will be seen by the original map which the fathers have sent from
Manila [to the said procurator]; and since the poverty and need of the
Society there are so great that if these favors and grants from your
Majesty cease it is impossible to support that college; and as it is
paying out much of the income from the little property that it
possesses, since it is indebted to the amount of 24,440 pesos of
principal at interest, and 13,623&frac12; pesos of scattered
debts&mdash;an amount which in the poverty of that country is enormous,
and causes much anxiety (and the said procurator presents the original
memorandum of these debts as it was sent to him by the
procurator-general of that province, and attests it with the necessary
solemnity); and since the Society there is rendering so continual
services to God and to your Majesty in working for the welfare of those
around it, both Christians and infidels: the Society ought to be
favored and protected by your Majesty. Therefore, the said procurator
humbly entreats that your Majesty will deign to confirm these two
favors, the site in the new Parian and the ferry-boat to the village of
Santa Cruz, and the exemption of the Sangleys from tribute. [He asks]
that an absolute refusal be not given before the new governor sends a
report, since the motives of Don Sevastian Hurtado de Corcuera for
exempting the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>young men resident in the village of Santa Cruz
who cut their hair were apparently sufficient reason for making this
concession; and that this report be awaited, and an unfavorable decree
be not despatched. This he will consider a grace and favor. He also
entreats that your Majesty will be pleased to command that no change be
made until reports on the matter be received, and a decision be made as
to what shall be most to your Majesty&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>[<i>Endorsed</i>: &ldquo;Let the decrees of the Council in regard to
this be brought.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the Council, on October 3,
1644.&rdquo; &ldquo;A decree has been issued.&rdquo;]</p>

<p><i>Decree by the governor</i></p>
<p>Don Sevastian Hurtado de Corcuera, knight of the Order of Alcantara,
member of his Majesty&rsquo;s Council of War, and his governor and
captain-general of these Philipinas Islands, and president of the royal
Audiencia therein. On account of the many losses which the Order of the
Society of Jesus in this city sustained in the general insurrection
which the Sangleys undertook against it&mdash;not only because the
possessions of the Society in the first Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys
and in other places were burned, but because they lost other
property&mdash;they now experience great poverty and want. Therefore,
inasmuch as it is proper that the Society be aided, in order that it
may support the religious who by their praiseworthy ministries are
serving the public welfare, for the present I grant, in the name of his
Majesty, to the said order of the Society of Jesus the concession of a
piece of land, one hundred brazas long and fifty wide, in the new
Parian of the said Sangleys, in whatever place the said order shall
select, provided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>that it be not in that part which has been
granted to the orphan boys,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1846src" href=
"#xd21e1846" name="xd21e1846src">1</a> in the old powder-house, in the
precincts of the royal chapel, or where other parties who are private
persons hold concessions made before the Parian was established there.
And this grant shall be free from obligation to pay to the city or to
any person the land-tax which others pay to the city, for the grant
which the Society has of the land which has been assigned to it and
which it occupies in the said Parian, since it is with the same
conditions and in the same form as the grant to the said orphan boys,
whom the Order of St. Dominic has in charge; provided that within four
years from the day on which this is dated, confirmation of this grant
from his Majesty be furnished. But if by any mishap it shall occur that
the confirmation cannot be obtained in the said time, it may be
extended for two years more&mdash;in all, a term of six years being
allowed. This is in consideration of the fact that the judge-commissary
has declared, by his act of the twenty-first of August last in this
year, that the half-annat ought not to be paid, because the said
concession is not equivalent to the said losses which the said order
has sustained in its houses and property. Given in Manila, on the first
day of September in the year one thousand six hundred and forty.</p>

<h2 class="main">EVENTS IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1643&ndash;44</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first"><i>Relation of the news and notable occurrences in
these Philipinas Islands, in the years of 43 and 44</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the two galleons which set out in the past year of
643 for Nueba Espa&ntilde;a, two months later the flagship returned,
dismasted, and entered the new port of Lapon,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1882src" href="#xd21e1882" name="xd21e1882src">1</a> where it was
made ready for sailing again this year. The almiranta, which made the
voyage successfully, has already arrived from its return trip; and the
news came today that it is remaining at Cagayan, and that the [new]
governor, Don Diego Faxardo, was coming as fast as he could by
land.</p>
<p>A Portuguese pilot belonging to a royal champan, one of the most
competent pilots in the ports, and well acquainted with these islands,
ran away with some men to Malaca, to inform the Dutch of our lack of
military supplies; and how the stockade, moat, and outer ditch, with
their towers at intervals (with which this city will be impregnable),
were incomplete; and that even the bells, and the iron grates of the
houses, had been cast [into cannon] for lack of metal; and how this was
true, since the deficiency arose through the cessation of the trade
with Japon and Macan, from which places the metal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>came. But all this information was rendered
useless by placing in Terrenate, in sight of the enemy, a large force
of excellent Spanish infantry, whom Don Lorenzo de Achotigui y Olaso,
master-of-camp for these islands, and second in authority therein in
the absence of the governor, carried with him [to Terrenate], himself
remaining there to govern those fortresses.</p>
<p><i>China</i></p>
<p>From China little cloth has come this year, and of that almost half
was carried away by the Dutch; for, sailing out to plunder with four
champans, they seized two others which were coming from China well
laden. The Chinese defended themselves during a day and a night, but
the only result of this was, that two hundred of their men were slain,
and hardly any one of the Dutchmen. The latter, seizing their prize,
set the rest of the Chinese ashore. A ship which came after this
encounter made port in Ilocos, and the cloth has been brought [to
Manila] in champans. Counting this one, only three ships have arrived
here this year; that is very little, compared with the coming of forty
ships. It is said that a mandarin, with two or three provinces, has
rebelled against the king of China,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1898src"
href="#xd21e1898" name="xd21e1898src">2</a> and is giving him much to
do. He has [to deal with] many pirates; of one of these, named Inloan,
it is said that he has this year gained two millions on the merchandise
that he has carried to Japon.</p>
<p>Christianity is making great gains in China; the king has granted a
chapa, or royal decree, allowing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178"
href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>all the religious to preach
freely and erect churches throughout his kingdom. This chapa is placed
at the entrances of the churches, and whenever the mandarins come in
sight of it they make the same obeisance to it as to their king,
venerating in it what he commands. It was granted at the instance of
the fathers of the Society of Jesus, and has been translated from
Chinese into our Castilian tongue by some of them. Its words mean that
the doctrine which the fathers teach is the doctrine from Heaven; and
states that inasmuch as they are so learned&mdash;for a very old clock,
which had rendered many years of service, and was out of order, could
not be regulated by any one until the fathers came; and they not only
put it in order, but made many other new ones, furnishing the pattern
to many cities&mdash;the king for this gave them permission to preach
the doctrine from Heaven. He also promised to grant them many favors
when they should complete a book for computing the Chinese years, which
run, by twelve moons [to the year], from the beginning of the world;
for a long time the mathematical fathers have been engaged in preparing
this book.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1905src" href="#xd21e1905" name=
"xd21e1905src">3</a> In this condition are the affairs of China.</p>
<p><i>Japon</i></p>
<p>The persecution against the Christians in Japon is as sharp as ever.
That country now has trade only with the Chinese and the Dutch; and
from seven <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>Dutch ships, which went this year to Japon, they
took three of the most prominent persons on each ship, and will detain
them as hostages until the Dutch pay them a large sum of money which
they owe in Japon. As for the fathers who went from these islands,
little can be learned about them; what we do know is obtained through
letters from Macan, written by very trustworthy persons. They say that
the fathers who first sailed thither died gloriously in the martyrdom
of the pits [<i lang="es">cuevas</i>];<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1919src" href="#xd21e1919" name="xd21e1919src">4</a> these are
the fathers Antonio Rubino, visitor for Japon; Alberto Polaco, a cousin
of the king of Poland; Diego de Morales, a native of Soria; Antonio
Capeche, an Italian; and Father Marquez, a native of Macan. Those of
the second shipment were summoned and carried as prisoners to the
court; it is not known what their end will be. God grant them the
strength and courage necessary for an achievement so heroic. As soon as
the news of the martyrdoms reached Macan, there was a solemn tolling of
bells; here, however, we have not made any demonstration, until the
truth of this report shall be confirmed by new letters.</p>
<p><i>Macan</i></p>
<p>The dissensions in that city have been so great that it is a wonder
that it has not been ruined by this time. The people have been divided
into two factions: one of them, which was the party of certain
honorable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>citizens, demanded that the Castilians, with
their commander Don Juan Claudio (who had gone there as envoy from the
governor of these islands), should be well treated, and sent with their
goods to Manila. But the other faction had more power, as they had the
arms, and the chief captain was on their side; accordingly, the
treatment that they accorded the Castilians has been so bad that the
letters which these have written come filled with a thousand
grievances. Their commander narrowly escaped being beheaded, and votes
for this were given in a conference held for this purpose. Finally they
sent him with two or three other persons, the most prominent [among the
Castilians], to Goa, placing on each two pairs of fetters, or tobas,
which is the way they shackle negroes. But it pleased our Lord that the
Dutch should seize this ship near India; and the kind treatment and
exemption from injury which are due to ambassadors, and was not found
among the Portuguese, was cause for admiration among those Dutch
heretics; for they received him with so much courtesy that they drank
his health, and told him that he was not considered as a captive. As
soon as the king of Macazar&mdash;who is our great friend, and calls
the king of Espa&ntilde;a his heir&mdash;knew of this he asked for Don
Juan and the rest of the Spaniards; and it is expected that they will
come soon. Nothing can be denied to this king, especially by the Dutch,
who have so great an interest in his trade.</p>
<p>All the Castilians who went from this city to Macan were arrested on
the pretext that they were rioters and disturbers of the peace in
Macan, [a city] always loyal to Don Juan the Fourth. They imposed the
penalty of death on any Castilians who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>should carry arms at
night, and shut them up in dungeons to sleep, so as to be sure of
holding them. One night the patrol chanced to encounter one of the
Castilians, who had been hidden in the houses of some friendly
citizens; and on the next day, for this offense alone, they held him
down and drove nails into his hand and his private parts. In fine,
things have occurred [there] which would not be seen in Negro-land. The
Dutch, by the aid of the kings of Tunquin and Cochinchina, sallied out
with three ships; one of these was wrecked while defending itself, and,
the two others retreating, a tempest suddenly came upon them, and broke
their masts. [<i>In the margin</i>: &ldquo;They took refuge in Macan,
where those heretics showed much kindness to the Castilians, who had
been so badly treated by the Portuguese&rdquo;] although the latter
were Catholic Christians. These Dutchmen did not know what was going on
in Yndia. Having repaired their masts, they went away with much wealth
of the Portuguese, which the latter had entrusted to them thinking that
there would be peace between them; and it is not so, but a very bloody
war. This, however, is but turning their own tricks against them of the
[Canton] River.</p>
<p>In one ship which the Dutch seized were the despatches from Goa to
Macan; these coming into the hands of the king of Macazar, he sent them
to the governor of these islands. Among these letters was one from the
intruding king Juan, in which he encouraged his vassals and those of
Macan, giving them an account of his successes; another from the
viceroy of Yndia, in which he rebuked the injurious and discourteous
language which they use when they mention our king Filipo Fourth, and
praised their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>loyalty. He also gave orders regarding the
Castilians, that their property&mdash;which must be more than three
hundred thousand pesos&mdash;should be taken from them, and they
themselves sent to Manila.</p>
<p><i>Therrenate and Macazar</i></p>
<p>As for the relief expedition which goes every year to Therrenate,
the one which went this year of 43 comprised two galleys, a galleon,
and a patache. One of the galleys was sent with an embassy to the king
of Macazar, to ask for iron and gunpowder, and other military supplies.
This galley was wrecked not far from here on a shoal; all the men were
saved, and were distributed among the other ships, which arrived at
Therrenate without hindrance from the enemy. Although the Dutch were
sailing in sight of us, with four ships, they did not dare to obstruct
our passage. The Spaniards supplied [the Therrenate forts], and the
other galley went on to Macazar with the envoy; the king promised to
supply soon what we asked for. Two small ships came with succor for the
Dutch; and when the fort fired the cannon at them they did not
answer&mdash;a sign that at least they did not have very good news.
They have not received aid from Olanda this year. At Therrenate the
most courageous captains and soldiers have remained, for the Dutch
enemy is feared, since last year he tried to attack that post.</p>
<p><i>Eastern Yndia</i></p>
<p>Yndia is in a very low condition. It is certain that Malaca has not
been recovered, and that the Dutch are keeping it as their own. The
viceroy asked them to comply with the peace or truce that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>is
said to have been effected in Europa; but they replied they would do so
if he would give them the island of Zeilan [<i>i.e.</i>, Ceylon], which
is exceedingly valuable on account of its cinnamon, pearls, and
crystal. He answered that he had no authority to do this; and the
Dutch, collecting some twenty ships, said that they would settle the
matter, and would reduce the whole island on their own account. They
held in that island some territory and a fortified post. But affairs
did not go as they intended, for their attack was repulsed, and they
accomplished nothing. With this armada they planned, as is known, to go
to Therrenate&mdash;but that plan was checked by the above mishap. Of
the ships of this armada, six undertook to attack the king of Camboxa;
but he defeated them, killing as many as five hundred persons, and
capturing three ships and some men. What ships he has, he has promised
to these islands, in exchange for money, since there is a lack of iron
here for building them.</p>
<p><i>Mindanao and Jolo</i></p>
<p>Cachil Corralat still lives, but is so harassed by the Spanish
soldiers that they hardly let him breathe. He has entreated peace, but
no importance is attached to his promises. The Spaniards say that they
will accept these on condition that he and his son come to Manila; that
he will allow the fathers to preach the Christian religion freely; and
aid them therein; and that he surrender his arms, and captives if he
has any. The prince of Jolo is making the same request, and in order to
obtain it he has written to the fathers of the Society who reside in
the forts of Jolo with the Spaniards, asking that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>will
mediate in his favor with the governor. [He states] that the people can
hardly secure food, since all their grain-fields are laid waste, and
most of their men were captured or slain in their many battles, and so
they desire peace&mdash;although no confidence can be placed in Moors,
who never fulfil any promise. Wherever the Spanish arms go, they also
bring the people under the yoke of the gospel. In Mindanao, more than
six hundred souls were baptized in two weeks, and that they did not
baptize more is only because they feared that they could not be sure of
so many; since most of these asked for baptism mainly to escape from
danger, the fathers did not grant it to all. This year there has been
much famine among the Indians, because the rice harvest was a poor one,
on account of the drouth, and because there came a multitude of
locusts, which covered the fields. In less than half an hour they
destroyed the grain in a [square] legua where they settled down; and
when they flew they formed so thick a mass that it seemed as if they
would hide the sun. Never has the like plague been seen here. At the
port of Cavite, an English ship&mdash;which is something new, as no
English have traded or been seen in these islands for many
years&mdash;brought commodities which the country needed, in abundance;
and thus was supplied the deficiency of cloth (of which very little has
come from China), and other articles which we do not get from
Spain.</p>

<h2 class="main">FISCAL&rsquo;S REPORT ON SANGLEY LICENSES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&#10016; <i>Report of Licentiate Don Sebastian
Cavallero, his Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal in this royal Audiencia of
Manila, recommending that the issue of the licenses called
&ldquo;fortification licenses,&rdquo; an increase of eleven reals which
was added to the general licenses, be suspended; and that all that has
been collected on the said fortification licenses and as increase of
the general licenses, be restored and be actually deposited in his
Majesty&rsquo;s royal coffers. With license, at Manila, in the year
1644.</i></p>
<p>For the clear understanding of this report, it is necessary to begin
by stating that all the Sangleys who come from China to these islands,
both for the purpose of selling their merchandise and to work in all
the trades needed by a community, have paid since the year 610 eight
pesos five reals by way of tribute (confirmed by decree of his Majesty)
for the license, which is called &ldquo;the general license,&rdquo; in
order that they may remain in the country. Immediately upon the arrival
of Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, member of his Majesty&rsquo;s
Council of War, in the year 635 to govern these islands, a new
imposition was made (shortly after he began to govern) of some specious
licenses for those Sangleys who desired to leave this city of Manila
for other parts and provinces of its jurisdiction. They had to pay for
that privilege an annual sum of ten pesos, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>although the obligation was only eight pesos
five reals, so that he burdened them with eleven reals. That increase
amounted annually to a very considerable sum; for those who generally
go out to buy and sell, and to work and cultivate the land, and engage
in the most servile offices of the country, are numerous. After the
insurrection and revolt of those Sangleys in 1639, the said Don
Sebastian ordered that from all the Sangleys should be collected, in
place of the eight pesos and five reals that they were paying yearly,
ten pesos (thus adding eleven reals to the tribute imposed and
confirmed by his Majesty), in order to punish them, to keep them under
surveillance and subject, and [to obtain a fund for] the
fortifications; and that the Sangleys who desired to leave the
Pari&aacute;n for other places, must pay another ten pesos in addition
to the ten pesos of the license and general contribution. Consequently,
each Sangley who leaves their Pari&aacute;n comes to pay twenty pesos
annually&mdash;ten for the old and general license and ten for the new,
which is called the &ldquo;government&rdquo; or
&ldquo;fortification&rdquo; license. Last year, 643, another
contribution (called the &ldquo;little&rdquo; license) of six reals
from each Sangley was imposed, to build the fortifications which are
being constructed on the side of Bagunbaya. It was all executed and
collected with the utmost exactness and punctuality by the judges of
the licenses, the constables-in-chief, and other officials who were
appointed and delegated for that purpose; and although all the proceeds
from that new assessment, and the contribution of the fortification
licenses, were given in a lump into the keeping of the royal officials,
this fund was not deposited at the account of and for the royal estate
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>his Majesty, but was entered separately, and was
placed at the disposal and will of Don Sebastian.</p>
<p>[Continuing from this point, Cavallero discusses the matter of the
imposition levied by Corcuera, in twenty-two sections, citing many laws
and authorities in support of his reasoning. The document seems to be a
portion of the evidence used in the residencia of Corcuera before his
successor, Diego Fajardo. The arguments adduced by Cavallero (here
mainly synopsized) are briefly as follows:</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;The imposition of gabels, tolls, vectigals,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1993src" href="#xd21e1993" name="xd21e1993src">1</a>
tributes, and other assessments and personal contributions, whether
patrimonial or mixed,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1996src" href=
"#xd21e1996" name="xd21e1996src">2</a> belongs by natural, divine, and
human right only to the sovereign and absolute majesty of princes, who
do not recognize any superior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. The new imposition made on the Sangleys by Corcuera is included
under the name of gabel and tribute.</p>
<p>3. Corcuera had no authority to make the new imposition; moreover,
the imposition of a new gabel is justified only when an urgent and
pressing necessity arises, and the sovereign cannot maintain himself or
carry on his military operations with his usual income.</p>
<p>4. If the tribute or new imposition is not justified by urgent
necessity, it is illegal.</p>
<p>5. The imposition made by Corcuera is illegal, as it was made
without any compelling necessity. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>is also
disproportionate, because it is equal for both the rich and the poor
Sangley, discriminating not one whit between them.</p>
<p>6. Corcuera&rsquo;s reason for making the new imposition was to
punish the Sangleys for their insurrection. He should first have
consulted with his Majesty in regard to it.</p>
<p>7. It is not a sufficient justification for the new imposition to
say that it was for the purpose of fortification; for those
fortifications built across the river near Tondo by virtue of that
imposition have been torn down, because they would prove a menace to
the Spaniards in case of hostile attack, for the enemy might find them
a base whence to carry on operations against Manila. The king&rsquo;s
permission is expressly necessary for the erection of new
fortifications and public works, and Corcuera did not have that
permission.</p>
<p>8. It is true, however, that a governor may repair the existing
fortifications without express permission of the king, although he is
forbidden to construct new fortifications.</p>
<p>9. It is also true that all persons must contribute to the expense
of repairing the fortifications; and consequently the new imposition
might be tolerated for that reason. &ldquo;Therefore his Majesty (whom
may God preserve) had assigned three thousand pesos for the
fortification and repair of the walls of this city, from the monopoly
of the playing-cards<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2021src" href=
"#xd21e2021" name="xd21e2021src">3</a>&mdash;which is paid every year,
according to the tenor of its establishment. Therefore, his Majesty
having succored that necessity and made preparations for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>that
expense, with a sufficient and sure sum of money, the little
justification for that new imposition can be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10 and 11. &ldquo;Again, supposing that his Majesty had not prepared
for that necessity, which is a compelling one, and it became necessary
to impose a tax and contribution for the repair and equipment of the
walls: it ought to be imposed solely on the citizens and inhabitants of
this city, according to the means and power of each one, and not among
the foreigners and transients like the Sangleys, who, coming to trade
this year, return the following year to China, where they have their
houses, families, and children.&rdquo; That imposition is therefore a
burden on the Sangleys.</p>
<p>12. &ldquo;It is clear, then, that as that imposition, so grievous
to the Sangleys, for the fortification and repair of the walls of this
city of Manila is not of advantage to them, as they are foreigners, but
on the contrary is very injurious to them, and introduced as a mark of
hatred toward them, they should not be obliged to pay that contribution
and assessment; but [this obligation would fall on] only the citizens
and those interested, for the repair, shelter, and defense of their
persons and patrimonies, in case that his Majesty had not provided the
said three thousand pesos from the monopoly of the playing-cards for
that purpose. Besides, that contribution for the repair of the walls
demands consideration of the means and ability of those making it and
should be in proportion thereto.&rdquo; Since the new imposition is
equal for all the Sangleys, rich and poor, that just proportion is
destroyed.</p>
<p>13. Even if those newly-imposed licenses had all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>the
justification and security that law can give, and his Majesty (may God
preserve him) had ordered them to be imposed, so zealous a minister as
Don Sebastian ought to have represented to his royal Council of the
Indias that these Sangleys have been made to pay for the privilege of
remaining in these islands the annual sum of eight pesos five reals
since the year 610. That brings his Majesty, according to the number of
the Sangleys now, 120,000 pesos annually. In the years 638 and 39, when
there were twenty-five or thirty thousand Sangleys (which was the time
of the insurrection), those licenses amounted to more than 230,000
pesos. Since that sum is so considerable, a risk was being incurred if
they were burdened with another imposition; for they might, oppressed
by so many exactions and assessments, abandon the commerce of those
islands, even though they perceived so much gain in them, and his
Majesty would because of these licenses lose that established
commerce.... Representing those reasons and inconveniences to his
Majesty, he ought to have suspended the execution of this measure
until, the matter having been conferred over in the royal Council of
the Indias, his Majesty should decree according to his pleasure. All
the more [should this be done] in lands and kingdoms recently acquired,
as are the Indias&mdash;where for many years after the conquest no
alcabala, gabel, or other contribution was imposed or asked until the
year 574, when general decrees were promulgated ordering that the
payment of the alcabala be introduced into the kingdoms of Piru and
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and that with great moderation and mildness. Don
Francisco de Toledo, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191"
name="pb191">191</a>]</span>viceroy of Piru,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2039src" href="#xd21e2039" name="xd21e2039src">4</a> suspended
the execution of the decree for many years, until the Marques de
Ca&ntilde;ete<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2048src" href="#xd21e2048"
name="xd21e2048src">5</a> ordered, in the time of his government, the
collection of that duty, by virtue of a new decree which he held.
Although, as is a fact, the excise duties are a royal right, so ancient
and accepted, and neither the Indians nor the Spaniards, their
colonists and conquistadors, paid his Majesty anything, the suspension
of [their collection by] Don Francisco de Toledo was regarded as
advisable, until pressing necessities compelled more severe
exactions.</p>
<p>14. It is to be presumed that whenever a king or ruler imposes a new
gabel on a province already burdened with one gabel, he does not know
that the first one is imposed, and that on learning it, he would not
add a new one to the old burden; &ldquo;and the greatest service to him
will be to suspend such imposition until [the governor] can inform the
king, laying the matter before him, and awaiting a new
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>15. But Corcuera may apparently take refuge in the royal decree of
June 19, 1614, if the governor of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192"
href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>the Philippines is entitled
by that decree to use all the authority granted to the viceroys of Peru
and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and hence may make the imposition.</p>
<p>16. It must be supposed then, that the governor has the same power
and authority as a viceroy in some matters.</p>
<p>17. But certain things are prohibited, forbidden, and excepted to
governors, viceroys, and proconsuls, and authority for these does not
extend to them, being reserved for the king or ruler.</p>
<p>18. Among these is the right to impose gabels and taxes, or the
increasing of such, without consulting the ruler.</p>
<p>19. Since the case stands thus, in order to give color of
justification to this tribute and new imposition of licenses the said
Don Sebastian ought, since he is so zealous for the increase of the
royal treasury, to have deposited its proceeds as a royal tax in the
royal coffers and treasury, just as the other incomes and tributes of
his Majesty are deposited, so that the money arising from it might be
paid in the salaries and other fixed expenses which his Majesty orders
to be paid by decrees and treasury and government ordinances, and by no
others, except by a special meeting of the treasury officials who
decide and resolve on such payment because of necessity or expediency.
What is worse is that, although the money received from the licenses
and impositions has been deposited in the royal coffers, it has not
been considered as belonging to his Majesty. Consequently, the said Don
Sebastian has expended it according to his own authority and
inclination, in the manner that he has judged to be best. He claims
obstinately that he can spend that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"
href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>royal income without
observing the form and order commanded by his Majesty in ordinance
number 18, because he put down the Sangley insurrection by conquering
the Sangleys, and imposed this burden and contribution on them without
your [<i>sic</i>; <i>sc.</i>, his] Majesty&rsquo;s
order&mdash;endeavoring thereby to get free power to dispose of the
royal dues by the same authority on which he trespassed in imposing
gabels on the Chinese. However, the greatest service that can be done
to kings is to observe and obey to the letter their royal commands and
ordinances directed to the efficient reckoning, administration, and
disbursement of their royal treasure. It is the king&rsquo;s will that
there be no extraordinary outlay, of a single real, without first
calling a meeting of the royal Audiencia and the royal officials, by
whose decision the extraordinary expense is justified. And if the
outlay and disbursement of so great sums of money as have proceeded
from the new imposition of fortification licenses and the
&ldquo;little&rdquo; licenses, has not been in this form, then he
ought, first and foremost, to deposit and deliver into the royal
coffers all the proceeds from those impositions, according to the
certification of the royal officials, from the time of their
institution until the present.</p>
<p>20 and 21. The fiscal states, first, that the proceeds of the new
imposition and the increase upon the old must be actually deposited in
the royal coffers, before all else.</p>
<p>Second, he declares &ldquo;that this new imposition of licenses has
caused universal harm and injury to the general welfare and the public
good, in whose conservation and advancement his Majesty is so much
interested, as one who is the father and shepherd of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>these poor sheep, so distant from the care of
their master. For although it was a fact that fifty almudes of rice
(the equivalent of two fanegas) were furnished for four reals in the
year 639, now one fanega is worth two pesos, and at retail much more.
The reason for that is, that since the principal farmers of these
islands are the Sangleys, and the latter cannot go out freely to work
and cultivate the land without paying a contribution so great as ten
pesos for their license, it proves impossible for them to go out [for
this work], as the mass of the farmers are always a poor and humble
people. On that account the land is deprived of its principal and
universal support, namely, that of rice&mdash;although the laws so
liberally dispense benefits and privileges to the farmers, so that they
may be contented, and be encouraged to serve the community with the
provisions and abundance that the land, grateful for its working and
cultivation, offers. The same is true in the fisheries and in other
necessary occupations, for the Sangleys are the feet and hands of this
land, as far as its sustenance is concerned, and this new imposition
has cut them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>22. It is clearly inferred from the above that although the Sangleys
are burdened by this new kind of license, that for fortification, those
who in reality and in fact have to pay it are the seventy citizens who,
according to the appraisement, live in this city of Manila. For if the
Sangley who comes from China to these islands to work does not bring a
single real from that country, and has to pay ten pesos for the general
license and ten for that of fortification, besides the
secretary&rsquo;s fees, it is necessary that his labor and the fruits
of it be sold for a double <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>price. Thus it is being
experienced that, although the ordinary pay of a workman&mdash;a
carpenter, or mason, or others&mdash;was formerly two reals, they are
now paid four or five, and the workmen are not willing to work for
that. It is necessary to beg them, and to pay them what they ask, for
there are no others who can perform these services. Where shoes were
worth two reals before, they are now worth four. It now costs four or
five pesos to have a garment made where before it cost two. The same
thing is true in everything else, and it all originated and proceeded
from the year of 639, with the increase of their burden for the general
license and the new imposition of the fortification license of ten
pesos apiece. That is so heavy a burden that I believe that no equally
grievous a personal assessment has ever been imposed throughout the
kingdoms subject to the monarchy of Espa&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>All these matters are very serious, hard to decide aright, and
worthy of being considered very closely and attentively. They concern
the discharge of the king&rsquo;s conscience, the royal authority, the
conservation and increase of the king&rsquo;s treasury and the royal
patrimony, and the public welfare and conservation of these islands.
For all of them, I beseech your Lordship to be pleased to provide and
order what shall be most to the service of his Majesty and the public
convenience. In that I shall receive grace and justice.] <span class=

Ca&ntilde;ete was viceroy of Peru from January 6, 1590 to July 24,
1596. So great was the demand from the Spanish government for money
that Ca&ntilde;ete exerted all his efforts to satisfy this claim; and
so oppressive were these exactions that rebellions arose, many natives
died, and the country was almost ruined. Markham (<i>History of
Peru</i>, pp. 161, 162) says that Ca&ntilde;ete asked to be relieved,
owing to the cares of his office and his broken health; and that Felipe
II treated him with shameful ingratitude.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To the Conde de Salvatierra, my relative, and viceroy,
governor and captain-general of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and president of
my royal Audiencia which there resides: Captain Melchor de Barrasa
Enrriquez, procurator-general of the Filipinas Islands, has reported to
me that the condition in which those islands are exposes them to
danger; that the colony is held together only by the few troops who
remain in it since the wars in Mindanao and the insurrection of the
Sangleys; and that, since this is the case, considering also the
Portuguese rebellion and the power which the Dutch possess, it is
necessary for that colony to stand continually on the defensive. For
this reason, it is desirable that you, and those who shall succeed you
in those offices, hasten the usual re&euml;nforcements [that are sent
there], and that these be considerable, both of men and of military
supplies&mdash;since those provinces [of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a] now
contain more idle people than ever before; and the Filipinas Islands
have a much smaller number of men than they always have had, on account
of losing so many in the military expedition above mentioned. In order
that these re&euml;nforcements may be sent in time, and may be
sufficiently large, it is decreed that you commence them early in
December, making repartimientos of men<a class="noteref" id=

provinces, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=

shall also command that the alcaldes-mayor and the corregidors shall
fill the respective quotas allotted to them, from the vagabonds and
criminals; for otherwise it will be impossible to collect a sufficient
number, or to further [the needs of] my service. Unless there can be
sent each year five hundred soldiers, and as many seamen as possible,
the relief will not be sufficient to meet the needs of those islands.
The amount of money sent should also be in accordance with what has
been decreed, and with it should go the supplies that shall be required
[for the islands. The said procurator-general] entreats that I be
pleased to command that an urgent decree of mine be despatched,
requiring you to send this relief promptly and efficiently, of all the
above kinds; and to report annually what you sent during the year. This
matter having been examined in my royal Council of the Yndias, together
with a letter to me from Don Diego Fajardo, my governor and
captain-general of the Filipinas Islands, written on February 29, 1644,
I command you&mdash;notwithstanding that I have charged you, by other
orders of mine, to re&euml;nforce and aid those islands, for the sake
of their preservation&mdash;that, in view of all the representations
that have been made to me in behalf of the city of Manila, and the
measures that have been proposed here, and the orders that you have
from me, you shall succor the said islands, endeavoring to secure their
preservation and prosperity by all the means in your power. You shall
be vigilant in doing this with the attention and diligence that the
matter demands, considering the frequency with which the enemies
attempt to invade those islands; and I shall <span class=

<h2 class="main">LETTER FROM FELIPE IV TO THE CONDE DE SIRVELA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To the Conde de Sirvela, my relative and member of my
Council, and my ambassador at Roma: The bearer of this, Fray Mateo de
Villa, of the Order of Preachers, procurator of the province of Sancto
Rosario of the Filipinas Islands, a part of my western Indias, has
informed me that his province possesses a college, that of Sancto
Thomas, in the city of Manila, of which I am patron, and which contains
thirty secular students. He says that this college has been a
university for several years by royal license; that bulls have been
conceded twice for its preservation; and that at the present time
grammar, rhetoric, the arts, and moral and scholastic philosophy are
taught there, to the special profit of the children of that community.
He begs me to have royal license given, so that the said college may be
a university, with the same qualifications and perpetuity as are
possessed by the other universities of his order in the convent of
Sancto Thomas at Avila, and in Sanctiago at Pamplona, in these my
kingdoms. His petition having been examined by the members of my royal
Council of the Indias; and having taken into consideration that the
city of Manila, of the Filipinas Islands, is situated more than three
thousand leguas from the nearest universities&mdash;namely, those of
Lima and Mexico&mdash;and that the said university experiences some
restriction; I have considered it fitting to lend my royal consent in
this matter, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>and to permit this concession to endure for the
present: provided that, if in future there should be any disposition to
found a separate university, that may be done, as in the cities of Lima
and Mexico, so that it may be a general university, in order that
students may be graduated from all branches of learning, and that all
its degrees may be valid everywhere. Therefore I charge and order you,
in my name, and by virtue of the letter of authority that I am writing,
to entreat his Holiness to be pleased to concede a bull, so that the
said college may become a university with the same qualifications and
perpetuity as those of Airla, Sanctiago de Pamplona, Lima, and
Mexico&mdash;as those islands and provinces have no university of this
rank. For this is advantageous to my service and to the public welfare
of those districts. You shall act as diligently in this matter, as I
expect you to do, so that the said bull be given immediately, and in
this wise will you serve me. Madrid, December 20, 1644.</p>

<p>Pope Innocent X, for the memory of this in the future.</p>
<p>Established by the divine order in the supereminent watch tower of
the apostolic see, although with inadequate merits, and reviewing in
the privacy of our consideration the extent to which the holy Catholic
faith is increased by the study of letters, and the worship of the true
God diffused, truth recognized and justice revered and observed, we are
gladly making efforts to have the said studies promoted, so that even
humble persons who desire to train themselves in those studies may
attain their desire. Applying for this purpose with more particular
inclination the vigilance of our solicitude, while at the same time the
desires of the faithful ones of Christ, and signally of those who are
conspicuous with royal dignity, entreat this: accordingly, having
considered the condition of those places, we judge, in the spirit of
God, that the following is beneficial and expedient.</p>
<p>Since there is in the city of Manila, of the Filipinas Islands in
the western Indias, a college called Sancto Tom&aacute;s, of the order
of the friars of St. Dominic, as has been lately told us in the name of
our very beloved son in Christ, Felipe, Catholic king of the
Espa&ntilde;as, wherein thirty collegiates are <span class=

philosophy, and scholastic and moral theology are studied and taught,
to the great profit of the inhabitants of those districts; and
considering that the city of Manila is more than three thousand leguas
from the two nearest universities with general curricula&mdash;namely,
Lima and M&eacute;xico&mdash;for which reason the said King Felipe is
especially desirous that a university be erected and instituted by us
in the said college (thus it was that we were humbly petitioned in the
name of the said Felipe that, in consideration of its utility to the
inhabitants of the said city, and to their instruction or education in
letters, we would, with apostolic authority, deign to erect and
institute a university in the above-mentioned city and in the buildings
of the aforesaid college, in which the religious of the said order may
publicly give instruction to and teach any youth grammar, rhetoric,
logic, philosophy, and scholastic and moral theology, and also make
seasonable provision in the other things above mentioned, in accordance
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2196" title="Source: wtih">with</span>
apostolic graciousness):</p>
<p>We therefore, desiring to show gracious compliance, and ourselves
being effectually inclined to the pious desires and petitions of King
Felipe, after invoking the opinion and advice of some of our beloved
sons&mdash;cardinals of the Holy Roman Church and other prelates of
this court, whom we assign to this duty&mdash;by the tenor of the
present, and without prejudice to any other, erect and institute, by
virtue of apostolic authority, a university in the said city of Manila,
in the buildings of the said college where the schools are at present,
or wherever they may be built hereafter in more ample form. In it the
religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>of the said order may publicly give instruction
to and teach any youth grammar, rhetoric, logic, philosophy, and
scholastic and moral theology. This shall have force only until some
public university with a general curriculum be erected by apostolic
authority in the said city of Manila, or in its province. We submit and
subject this said university, thus founded and instituted, by the
aforesaid authority and perpetually to the supervision, management, and
administration of the said order, and that of its master-general, now
and forever, or of the person whom he shall assign, who shall be the
rector of the whole university.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: By the authority and tenor of these presents, we
concede and grant to the said university, its rector, masters,
students, and to all and each one of the aforesaid, power to obtain,
employ, and enjoy, all and singular, the privileges, indults,
liberties, immunities, exemptions, favors, concessions, prerogatives,
honors, and pre&euml;minences conceded to like universities, and to
their successive rectors, masters, lecturers, doctors, teachers,
students, procurators, beadles, envoys, officials, and helpers, and all
other persons, however these may be conceded to them, whether in
general or in special&mdash;not only in their similitude, but in like
form and with complete and equal excellence. And besides this, we
concede to the rector of the said university and college, henceforth
and forever, as long as the said university endure, as above stated,
power to promote and graduate those who shall have studied their due
time in this university thus founded, and whom he shall consider as
qualified in learning and morals, as bachelors, licentiates, doctors,
and masters in those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206"

the said college, observing in all and through all the form of the
decrees of the councils of Vienne and of Trent<a class="noteref" id=

decrees we are not minded to violate in any respect&mdash;and also the
praiseworthy customs of the other universities, and to give to such
graduates the insignia of such degrees. Those thus promoted and
graduated by the rector may afterward, publicly and privately, even
though it be in all the other academies and universities with general
curricula, expound the above-mentioned studies, and teach others, may
dispute concerning them, and perform the acts suitable to the degree or
degrees that they may possess. They shall also be enabled to exercise
and enjoy all the rights, privileges, favors, concessions,
prerogatives, and indults, that are exercised, and enjoyed, and that
may be exercised and enjoyed hereafter, by right or custom, by those
legitimately graduated from the said schools, either in other academies
or universities, or in any other place, in all respects, as if they had
received their degrees in the said academies or universities, in
accordance with the usages and customs of those institutions.</p>
<p>By virtue of the aforesaid authority and tenor, we also concede and
grant authority to the master-general of the said order, now and
forever, that any statute and ordinance&mdash;so long as it be legal
and proper, and not contrary to the sacred canons and decrees of the
Council of Trent and apostolic constitutions&mdash;may be published and
promulgated by himself, by the rector of the college and university
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=

according to what is thus advisable for the wholesome and successful
administration of the university, and proper to the duties and
obligations of rector, master, procurators, beadles, envoys, and all
other assistants and officials. In respect to the manner and form of
instruction, the employment of each one in his duties, and the
maintenance of the students, the said officer may publish and
promulgate any statutes or ordinances&mdash;provided they be lawful and
reasonable, and not contrary to the sacred canons, or the decrees of
the Council of Trent, or the apostolic constitutions; and these
statutes and ordinances may be changed, corrected, and recast, or
repealed and annulled and others established anew, according to the
character of the times, affairs, and persons; and he may impose what
penalties seem best to him for their observation and fulfilment. He may
freely appoint and remove the doctors, lecturers, students,
procurators, beadles, and all other assistants and officials of the
university, or confirm the appointments made of them.</p>
<p><i>Item</i>: We decree that these present letters must and shall be
valid, firm, and efficacious; that they shall have and obtain their
plenary and complete effects; and that thus and in no other manner
ought they be judged and defined by any judges, ordinary or delegated,
even though such be the auditors of the causes of the apostolic palace,
and cardinals of the Holy Roman Church. And further, if any person, of
whatsoever rank he be, should perchance attempt to contravene the
decree herein contained, whether knowingly or ignorantly, his
opposition shall be void and invalid, notwithstanding the apostolic

<p class="salute">Sire:</p>
<p>Don Alonso de Cardenas, in a letter to your Majesty of November 23
of last year, states that your Majesty was pleased to have him informed
in a letter of September 14, that, inasmuch as the proposition of the
East-Indian merchants of that kingdom regarding permission to trade in
Manila and other ports of Philipinas, has not been thought advisable,
he may close the discussion as civilly as possible. He should try to
ascertain whether the said company<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2236src"
href="#xd21e2236" name="xd21e2236src">1</a> of English merchants is
introducing any regular navigation from that kingdom to the Philipinas,
in what form, whether it may be expected that it will continue to
acquire strength, and any other information that he may be able to
obtain, and advise you of what he may discover. Conforming to these
instructions he has begun to mistrust that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=

proposed, and has learned that the said Company of India is not sending
any vessel directly to the Philipinas; but that two or three vessels
that they despatch annually to the city of Bantan, in the kingdom or
province of Simatria<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2244src" href=

to Bantan where the English of this company have commerce and settled
communication, and where one of them lives, with the title of president
of the company. This company is not confirmed by the parliament, nor
does it enjoy the privileges that they wish for its establishment.
However, they expect both these shortly in reference to which a
merchant of the said company told him [<i>i.e.</i>, Alonso de Cardenas]
that the commerce of India would increase, and that six or seven
vessels would be sent annually to Bantan, whence two or three would go
to Manila and other ports of the Philipinas. The above is the extent of
his knowledge acquired in order to inform your Majesty. The Council
having examined it, and Don Francisco de Melo and the marquis of
Valparayso concurring in their opinion, it is fitting that Don Alonso
be advised that we have received his communication, and approve his
care in acquiring and sending this information; and that a copy of this
letter be sent to the Council of the Indias&mdash;although in the
condition of affairs, no difficulty is looked for in the course of this
matter. Your Majesty will order what is most pleasing to you? At

India Company of England (formed in 1600) encountered great opposition
and hindrances in its early history; they had to compete with the
long-established Portuguese and Dutch trade, and could obtain little
aid from the English government. In 1619 they formed an alliance with
the Dutch company of the same name, but this soon proved ineffective.
They had obtained control of Surat in 1612, but were thus involved in
continual quarrels with the Portuguese. This company did not secure
recognition from the English parliament until 1657; this brought them
much prosperity for a time, but they afterward lost much of what they
had gained, and in 1680 were expelled by the Dutch from Bantam. See
Raynal&rsquo;s account of early English trade in the East Indies, in

<p>Fortune was not born to endure. The ancients depicted her without
feet upon which to stand, but with wings and hands&mdash;without feet,
because she never was willing or able to remain in any event, whether
fortunate or unfortunate; with wings, that she might fly, like the
wind, at her own inconstant will; and with two hands, because if with
one she caresses and elevates, with the other she smites and beats
down&mdash;as far down as she had before upraised. She supports, it is
true, with one hand the earth and with the other the sea; but she shows
herself, by turns, favorable and adverse to both elements. Now
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=

stern to the sea; and when Fortune pleases she crosses her hands, so
that no one may trust to her favors or despair at the injuries that she
inflicts. This is a fable and an ancient picture, but it also contains
a moral, to teach the uncertainty of human affairs.</p>
<p>The [Christian] faith recognizes no Fortune but that of the divine
will and providence, from whose hand depends the structure of the
globe, and from whom all events, whether prosperous or adverse,
proceed. With one hand <span class="corr" id="xd21e2297" title=

to states, to correct and curb their excesses; and with the other
(which still remains full, from His natural beneficence) He gives them
prosperity and happiness&mdash;tempering the sharpness of the one with
the sweetness of the other. And if, at times, He seems to be severe to
Earth, afflicting her with earthquakes, disasters, and other
calamities, it is that she may acknowledge herself subject to His will,
and not rely upon her own stability. At the same time, He may be
benignant and favorable to the sea, rendering it glorious in events,
triumphant in battle, fortunate and renowned in victory.</p>

<p class="first">Such was the condition of the islands at the end of
June in 44, when Se&ntilde;or Don Diego Faxardo, knight of the Order of
Santiago and member of his Majesty&rsquo;s Council of War, who had been
sent as their proprietary governor landed on the extreme point of this
island of Manila after a difficult and long voyage, due either to the
early beginning of the vendavals, or to having sailed late from
Acapulco. He found the islands deficient in naval strength, since the
few ships there were had been sent to Terrenate to oppose the
threatened invasion of the enemy that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

middle of August his Lordship made his entrance into Manila and took
possession of the government; and early in September he despatched the
galleons &ldquo;Encarnacion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rosario,&rdquo;&mdash;which were waiting equipped and ready to
sail&mdash;to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. At the end of October,
re&euml;nforcements were sent to Terrenate and other provinces. As
early as April, 45, the Dutch enemy had three small round vessels and
as many others (or rather champans<span class="corr" id="xd21e2324"
title="Source: ,">)</span> off the coasts of Ilocos and Pangasinan for
the aforesaid purpose. At that time there was neither a ship nor a
galley in Cavite which could be armed to oppose the enemy, and
therefore only champans and oared vessels were sent out, under command
of Captain Sebastian Lopez (a man whose valor, spirit, and ability will
be hereafter related; he had come with the governor as captain of
infantry), and of other captains and leaders&mdash;all picked officers
of this camp, and men so courageous that, although their fleet was so
inferior to that of the enemy, they were enabled to frustrate the
designs of the Dutch and save the Chinese merchantmen. On two different
occasions they engaged the champans of the enemy, three to three, with
such valor and good fortune that both times the enemy was ignominiously
routed with great loss of men; one of their champans being burnt and
the others destroyed, while our losses were but few. This was a happy
beginning and augury of the victories and brilliant successes of our
arms on the sea, although an expensive and dangerous expedition, as it
obliged the enemy, on the following year, to bring all his forces
against the islands, as will be hereafter related, at the proper

information received by his royal Council regarding the

With these galleons came his Lordship Don Fernando Montero de Espinosa,
bishop of Nueva Segovia and archbishop-elect of Manila; he was a
prelate of promise and ability, as is known to the [Spanish] court.
Heaven did not will that Manila should enjoy his presence, or merit
seeing him alive, but only when he was dead; for even while all the
people were preparing a magnificent reception for him, with suitable
festivities and rejoicings, they were called upon for tears and
mourning in solemnizing his funeral rites. His illustrious Lordship
reached the port with poor health. The land-routes which they had to
take in traveling from Lampon to the lake [of Bay] and the river of
Manila are very rough and steep, without any convenience or comfort of
inns. His illustrious Lordship, by making the journey easier for others
through his charity, traveled through those mountains so destitute of
comforts that on the same day when he reached the lake he became

crowd of handsomely adorned boats awaited him at the mouth of the
Manila<a id="xd21e2338" name="xd21e2338"></a> [<i>i.e.</i>, Pasig]
River; they looked like a garden of flowers, and contained musicians
who played their instruments together. But they received his venerated
body, with the trappings of grief, and with mournful lamentations.</p>

<h3 class="main">4. <i>Earthquakes</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This event was for Manila an omen of punishments,
which were not long delayed. On the thirtieth of November, the day of
St. Andrew, the patron of this city, there occurred the most lamentable
and disastrous earthquake that has been known on these islands since
the Spanish conquest and occupation. Manila, when it was first founded,
was composed of wooden houses covered with thatch of palm leaves, which
are used by the natives in their buildings; this [inflammable material]
had resulted in many fires which in several years and on various
occasions had burned and consumed the wealth of Manila. In order to
provide against these disasters from fire, the Spaniards commenced to
build their houses of stone and tiles, without any pressing fear of the
earthquakes&mdash;which, although they usually occur here every year,
have not [before] caused destruction [which could arouse much]
apprehension. Accordingly, during the forty years, more or less, that
have elapsed since the last fire, beautiful edifices were erected, and
dwellings were built so high and spacious that they seemed like
palaces. Magnificent temples, with stately and beautiful towers were
erected within and without the walls of Manila, rendering it very
handsome and distinguished; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218"
href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>it was not less suitable for
health and enjoyment. But the result has proved that the inhabitants of
Manila, while avoiding in their buildings the activity of fire, fell
into the terrible power of the earth.</p>
<p>On the aforementioned day of the apostle St. Andrew, patron of this
city&mdash;[chosen] on account of the victory gained on that day by the
early conquerors and settlers over the pirate Limahon, who with sixty
Chinese vessels had attacked Manila, and would have gained possession
of the city if, through the intercession of the holy apostle, a few
Spaniards who had retired to the fort had not returned to the defense
of the city&mdash;on the anniversary of this day, then, it pleased God
again to deprive us of the city, on account of our sins. The banner had
been brought forth<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2354src" href=
"#xd21e2354" name="xd21e2354src">4</a> in the morning, and the divine
services celebrated with the customary pomp, and attendance and
presence of the governor, Audiencia, and regidors. In the evening, at
eight o&rsquo;clock, they had just finished ringing the <i lang=
"es">animas</i> in the cathedral, the parish churches, and the
convents; the sky was clear, the moon bright, and the air calm and
still, after a long period, even months, of clear and dry weather.
Suddenly a frightful crash was heard, and the earth began to quake so
violently that it seemed as if it would become a sepulchre for all the
inhabitants. As a result, during the space of four <i lang=
"es">Credos</i>&mdash;the time during which the first shock lasted, the
earthquake passing from north to south, and then from east to west,
with a rapid movement&mdash;in that brief time it flung to the ground
the most beautiful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219"
name="pb219">219</a>]</span>and magnificent buildings in this city. The
stone walls were shaken and bent like sheets of paper or parchment
fluttered by the wind; the towers swayed and bent like trees; and the
largest trees [broke] like the masts of a ship in the midst of a fierce
hurricane. Nothing was heard but the crash of buildings mingled with
the clamor of voices entreating Heaven for mercy, the cries of the
terrified animals adding to the horror. In the streets could only be
seen the heaps of stone from the ruined houses, which hindered the
flight of those who in frightened haste were leaving their homes. At
the first shock of the earthquake, which filled all with fear, some
tried to save their lives in the open spaces of their doors and
windows; but this effort availed nothing to many, for the houses
falling flat, buried them under the stones and timbers. Others sought
to take refuge in the churches; but as many of these had fallen, and
others were in a dangerous condition, they could not find a refuge
there. Accordingly, all who could directed their flight to the plazas,
and, the gates of the city being at once opened, they fled to the beach
and the fields, where they whom the earth cast out might look toward
the heavens.</p>
<p>Charity animated by religious zeal was at once displayed by the
prebends, canons, and members of the [cathedral] chapter, and,
following their example, by all the clergy; and by the religious of the
four orders&mdash;Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans (those of the
Society of Jesus), and the Augustinian Recollects&mdash;who flourish in
these islands in holiness and in zeal for the saving of souls. All,
vying with each other in good works, went about amid the greatest
danger, risking their lives in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220"
href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>ruins of the fallen houses,
which were left broken and torn apart from each other, to disinter the
dead, and to save the lives of those who were holding off death for a
little time or lengthening their span of life in the clear space made
by some timbers&mdash;which now were their defense, but soon would be
the coffin or tomb of the very bodies which before they protected. Had
this religious solicitude been wanting, the injured would also have
failed to receive the last absolution, the remedy for the greatest
sinners, since contrition is so uncertain, and in such dangers so
difficult.</p>
<p>While engaged in this labor the religious experienced no little
pain, although mingled with consolation, in hearing from the ruins
voices entreating them to hear confessions. The sufferers were consoled
by the religious, who exhorted them to [show their] sorrow for their
sins by fervent acts of contrition; for these absolution was given to
them, as is done on the battle-field or in a storm at sea. Thus all the
religious incurred so great danger that no one felt himself secure; for
the shocks did not cease, although they were less severe than at first.
They were accompanied by so loud a crash that its noise could be heard,
even before the quaking of the earth, far away&mdash;as when, in Spain,
there is a hail-storm.</p>
<p>The night was everywhere very clear, as the moon was full; and for
the sufferers night shone brighter than the day, for God greatly
illumined their souls, and revealed the sins that had brought upon them
this punishment. Even the children incapable of sin fell on their knees
and begged to confess; nor was there any person so stony-hearted,
although so many were made homeless by God, that he was not softened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>and turned to Him. A Franciscan-religious
carried the blessed sacrament from the convent of Santa Clara to the
main plaza, where a great many people had gathered; so loud were the
sobs, cries, and groans of the people that it seemed like a day of
judgment. Some bemoaned their children who remained buried in the
ruins; others, their parents and relatives. For some, there was no one
to weep, since the entire family had perished. We all lamented our
sins, as a punishment for which this calamity had befallen us.</p>
<p>In the first shock one hundred and fifty of the finest buildings,
which in other cities would be called palaces, were totally destroyed;
all the other houses were so damaged and dangerous that it has been
necessary to demolish them completely. It may be said with truth that
only a semblance of Manila remains. There has been no means of
ascertaining the actual number of the dead; those known to be missing
are four hundred and fifty, and the number would have been greater if
the earthquake had occurred two hours later when all would have been
sleeping.</p>
<p>This is a general account; and we will now proceed to make some
special mention of the ruins.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">5. <i>Ruins of the City</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The building of the palace and royal Audiencia was
mostly overthrown; and the governor, Don Diego Faxardo, who at the time
had retired to his apartments, was in danger of being buried in the
ruins. But it pleased the Lord that he escaped, without injury, to the
Plaza de Armas, where a field-tent was set up for him, in which he
lived for several <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span>months, until a suitable dwelling of wood
was built for him. The greater part of the royal chapel also fell, and
what remained was in so bad condition that it will be necessary to
build it practically anew. The cathedral was totally destroyed; tower,
roofs, chapels, and even the foundations, were overthrown. The hospital
for the Spaniards was ruined, but no one was killed; for to those who
were very ill, and unable to move their bodies, necessity gave swift
feet to carry them to a place of safety. The seminary of Santa
Potenciana, which is a refuge for orphan girls and the wives of
deserving men who are absent, was greatly damaged; one wing fell, and
carried down many girls, eight being killed, and thirty wounded. At the
seminary of La Misericordia, which also is a refuge for girls, the
house was not much damaged; but the church, which was handsome and
elegant, was so injured that a great part of it has been pulled down,
in order to rebuild it. Outside of the city walls, the parish church of
Santiago and its tower were overthrown; and an Indian, who was ringing
the <i lang="es">animas</i>, said that a cavalier told him that he
would save him; and the Indian was actually found lying on the ground,
without any injury. It seems a miracle, although it can be easily
understood that the great St. James, whose church that was, rewarded
the good deed of ringing the <i lang="es">animas</i> by saving the
Indian. The churches of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia and San Antonio
were rendered unserviceable. The Order of St. Dominic lost its convent
and church, and a great part of the college of Santo Tomas; but neither
the religious nor the students were injured. Another building, that of
the seminary called San Juan de Letran&mdash;for orphan boys,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>who are under instruction by the fathers of that
order&mdash;fell to the ground; and it was through the providence of
the Lord that all the boys, more than one hundred and twenty in number,
escaped alive. The church of the fathers of St. Francis was badly
shaken, and the walls surrounding the convent were ruined, as well as a
hospital for the mulattoes, in which some perished. It was necessary to
remove the nuns from the convent of Santa Clara and shelter them in the
orchards belonging to the house of a gentleman, who piously lent that
place so that they might sojourn there with the satisfaction and
propriety of their own cloister. The order that suffered least was that
of the fathers of St. Augustine, although their convent was
considerably shaken, and the church tower fell. The Recollect fathers
of the same saint were not so fortunate; a great portion of their
convent and church fell, killing a religious who was a faithful servant
of God and thus regarded by all. The Society of Jesus did not fare the
worst: the class-rooms for arts and theology (which was an old
building) fell, and a part of the main structure in the new building,
which is very handsome and costly. The church, although it is the
tallest in Manila, stood firm&mdash;except that the tiles fell from the
cupola. At the college of San Joseph (which is in charge of the same
order) one wing fell down, and was entirely demolished; and the rest of
the building was badly shaken, especially an elegant chapel which was
adorned by pictures of the twelve apostles. Not one of these pictures
was thrown down by the earthquake, except that of St. Andrew, in token
that on his day his church and even the city were destroyed.</p>
<p>Outside of Manila and within its district many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>churches, and convents of different orders which
ministered to the natives, were ruined. Notable among these was the
church in the village of San Miguel, administered by the fathers of the
Society; both church and house were totally ruined. In the house, at
the time, were Father Francisco de Roa, the provincial, and Father Juan
de Salazar, who had been provincial six years before. Father Francisco
de Roa was buried up to his shoulders in the ruins, from which he was
rescued badly injured. Father Juan de Salazar lost this earthly life,
but gained the divine life of heaven, which he had already imitated on
earth; he was removed, mortally injured, from the ruins, but there was
time to absolve him and administer the sacrament of extreme unction; he
expired shortly afterward, with the peace of spirit which his great
purity of conscience had secured him. Also near Manila, in the village
of Minondoc, in charge of the fathers of St. Dominic, their magnificent
church, the erection of which had been completed a few years before,
was overthrown; the convent of San Francisco del Monte, and its church,
which belongs to the religious of St. Francis, were destroyed; and the
convent of Santa Ana was so much damaged as to be uninhabitable. A
great many handsome and delightful houses for recreation, on the banks
of the river, were also destroyed. It may be said, in a word, that the
whole of Manila was destroyed; for neither within nor without the city
was there a building which did not need a great deal of repair to make
it habitable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=

<h3 class="main">6. <i>Other damages and effects of the earthquake in
the islands</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All this occurred in that night; at dawn on the
following morning, most of the people left the city and took shelter in
the suburbs, [even] in the humblest huts of the Indians, which are
built of bamboo and nipa. Others built huts in the plazas and on the
beach, to which they came as exiles from their own houses and native
land, yet in sight of it.</p>
<p>Surrounded, as we are, by so many thousands of infidels, the fact
that no lawless acts occurred was due to the foresight and care of Don
Diego Faxardo, governor of the islands. He ordered the sargento-mayor
and commander of the troops, Manuel Estacio Venegas (who is at present
the officer nearest to the government, and with faithfulness and care
puts into execution its official acts and those belonging to the
military department), to man the walls; and that the cavaliers should
be occupied by the infantry companies and the inhabitants, which was
done. Troops were also sent outside of the city, and detachments were
formed to protect those who had left it and taken shelter in the
suburbs.</p>
<p>Processions and public prayers then followed, and all were
accompanied with as many acts of penitence as in Holy Week; many
confessed, and few contented themselves with what had occurred since
their last confession, but confessed the sins of a lifetime. To this
end the religious hastened through the fields, the beach and the
plazas, and were untiring in the labors of their ministries; they
preached penitence to those who did not need many arguments to move
them to comply. The dead were buried by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>dozen; every one prayed to God for mercy, and
entreated that He would withhold His scourge.</p>
<p>On the fifth of December, five days after the first shock of
earthquake, another one occurred as violent as the first, at eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night, but no fatality occurred, as all were prepared;
the destruction of many other buildings was completed; and the city was
left in such condition that one could not walk through it. The effects
of these shocks were terrible, also, in other provinces of these
islands. Whole Indian villages were overthrown, as their huts are built
of so light materials, bamboos and palm-leaves; and hills were leveled.
Rivers were dried, which afterward flowed again; others, leaving their
beds, inundated the villages; great fissures, and even chasms, appeared
in the open fields. In the Manila River the disturbance and commotion
in its waves was so great that it seemed as if they would flood all the
country; for their fury urged the river from its bed, and its waters
flowed over the bridge.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2416src" href=
"#xd21e2416" name="xd21e2416src">5</a></p>
<p>The anxiety and disquiet in the country continued throughout the
year, until the corresponding moon,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2424src"
href="#xd21e2424" name="xd21e2424src">6</a> which was in December,
1646; in that month, and in the forty days, succeeding, the shocks,
disturbance, and quaking were lessened, giving to philosophers abundant
material for discussing natural causes, and to theologians and
preachers cause for revering the divine judgments and exhorting sinners
to contrition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>and repentance. Great changes have taken place
in lives and morals; the important thing is, that these shall

<h3 class="main">7. <i>Dutch fleet against Manila</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this unfortunate condition had God placed Manila,
when the infernal dragon again brought his power to bear against her
from the direction of the sea. The heretic Dutchman was piqued and even
enraged that, after so many years and so much expenditure, he had not
secured any of the relief ships from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. He was also
angry at the little reputation that he had gained in the battle between
the champans in the preceding year; and at the little advantage that he
had obtained from the attempt against the fort of Jolo, as will soon be
told. Accordingly, to obtain satisfaction for these debts, they
determined, in the great council of their Nueva Batavia (which we call
Jacatr&acirc;) to make, this year, a last attack upon these islands.
For this purpose (according to advices from Maca&ccedil;ar) they
equipped eighteen vessels and divided them into several squadrons. The
first, of five ships, was for the coasts of Pangasinan and Ilocos,
against Chinese vessels; the second, of seven vessels (their most
powerful ships, the sinews of their [naval] power), went to the
Embocadero, to seize the money and supplies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>that
were expected from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; the other six were despatched
to cut off our relief ships to Terrenate and Maca&ccedil;ar, and
finally they were to go, after the monsoon, to rejoin the twelve ships
in this bay of Manila, in an attack upon the city. This, according to
report, was their plan, and therein Manila has much for which to thank
God; for it was a scheme of Heaven for our benefit, that these
squadrons should come to us separately.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 chapter"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">8. <i>Our first squadron of defense</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The news of the first squadron arrived on the first
day of February. The two galleons, &ldquo;Encarnacion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rosario,&rdquo; which had brought the succor from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, were already at Cabite; for with especial forethought
and vigilance orders had been given them to stop unlading the silver
that they carried, and to come to that port. Although it seemed an act
of temerity for two ships to oppose so many, his Lordship&mdash;urged
on by his great valor and resolution in these matters of
war&mdash;after a conference and council which he summoned for this
purpose, decided that the two galleons should make ready for battle. In
the flagship (which was the &ldquo;Encarnacion&rdquo;) were mounted
thirty-four pieces of artillery, all of bronze and of the
re&euml;nforced<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2452src" href="#xd21e2452"
name="xd21e2452src">8</a> class, which variously carried balls of
thirty, twenty-five, and eighteen pounds. The almiranta (which was the
&ldquo;Rosario&rdquo;) was equipped with as many as thirty pieces, of
the same capacity&mdash;although, on account of the deficiency in this
sort of artillery, it was necessary to dismantle some posts in the
fortifications of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229"
name="pb229">229</a>]</span>this city and of Cavite. Munitions and
supplies of every kind with devices for carrying fire, and other
necessary articles, were furnished to them in abundance. These two
ships were supplied with men&mdash;in each, two companies of a hundred
soldiers (all picked men, of the nobility and youth of Manila), eighty
mariners, artillerists according to the number of cannon, and a
suitable number of deck-hands and other servants, making, in all, over
four hundred persons on each galleon. As commander-in-chief his
Lordship appointed General Lorenzo de Orella y Ugalde, a Biscayan,
under whose charge the vessels had sailed from Acapulco; this choice
was made, not only because of his proved bravery, his experience in the
art of war, and his services and commands in both the Northern and the
Southern Seas, as well as in these islands (particularly in Mindanao,
where he fought hand to hand with a gigantic Moro and killed him), but
because of his well-known Christian spirit and modesty&mdash;which, for
success, are no less important than valor. Captain Sebastian Lopez, an
Andalusian, was appointed admiral, with the right of succession to the
commander. This post was due him because he had distinguished himself,
the previous year, in the fight with champans, against these same
Dutch, of which I have already spoken. The post of sargento-mayor was
given to Don Agustin de Cepeda, a cavalier of nobility and acknowledged
courage&mdash;displayed in the most difficult and honorable posts of
these islands. The heads of the infantry companies were: on the
flagships, Captains Juan Henriquez de Miranda and Gaspar Cordoso; on
the almiranta, Captains Juan Martinez Capelo, and Don Gabriel
Mi&ntilde;o <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>de Guzman. The chief pilots were Captains
Domingo Machado and Estevan Ramos; their associates were Francisco
Romero and Andres Cordero&mdash;all persons of courage, bravery,
experience in their craft, and resolution, as the result will show.</p>
<p>For spiritual aid and ministry to all this armada&mdash;which, since
the galleons were named &ldquo;Encarnacion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rosario,&rdquo; went forth under the protection of our Lady the
Virgin Mary&mdash;his Lordship accepted on this occasion the offer of
chaplains and ministers which was made to him by the order of the
glorious patriarch St. Dominic. Accordingly four religious (who were
priests) were assigned to this post and embarked on the ships, two in
the flagship and two in the almiranta. As a result of the excellent
teaching and the fervor of these fathers, arrangements were made that
all the men should, in the first place, purify their consciences with
the holy sacraments of penance and communion; that they should take as
their special patron saint the Virgin of the Rosary; that, in order to
bind her further, they should vow to her a feast-day in thanksgiving
for the victories which they expected to receive through her agency;
and that every day all should recite prayers aloud, on their knees, and
in two choirs&mdash;the prayers of the rosary before our Lady&rsquo;s
image, the litanies of the most holy name of Mary, and finally an act
of contrition. All this was done, accordingly, throughout the period of
six months while this expedition lasted&mdash;especially on the days
and occasions when they had to fight.</p>
<p>Matters thus arranged, and all preparations made that were required
for both their spiritual and corporal needs, on the third of March in
the year 646, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>before the galleons raised the last anchor, the
governor, Don Diego Faxardo, came in a falua to the ships. He made a
set speech to the men, reminding them of their obligations and the
reputation of the Spanish arms; and he promised them, beforehand, the
reward of their deeds which in the name of his Majesty (whom God
protect) he had recently offered them. He expressed his regret that he
could not embark with them, and courteously took his leave; and
acknowledged the &ldquo;Pleasant voyage!&rdquo; with which he was
saluted, according to marine usage. Then the ships immediately weighed
their anchors and set sail. At the same time, by a special order which
his Lordship had left behind, the blessed sacrament was exposed in the
royal military chapel, and in other churches of this city&mdash;a
devotion which was continued during the entire period while the
galleons were out.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">9. <i>The first battle</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On arriving at the entrances of Mariveles, the ships
were placed in battle array, the artillery loaded, the matches lighted
and the linstocks ready, the rigging free, and other preparations made.
This was done because the sentinels [on Mariveles Island] warned our
men that the enemy were, with their squadron, not far from that place,
in the port of Anus; and that they might expect at any moment to
encounter the Dutch&mdash;although in fact the latter were not descried
until the fifteenth of the said month of March. At nine o&rsquo;clock
in the morning of that day, our almiranta&mdash;which had pushed ahead
of the flagship perhaps half a legua, and was sailing with a northwest
wind&mdash;fired two cannon-shots and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>lowered the
maintop-sail as a signal that it descried the enemy. The flagship put
about, and followed her, and from the maintop they soon saw a sail in
the distance, but it was impossible to overtake it; and it soon
disappeared, because it was favored by a fresher wind than our ships
had. After that, our galleons were left becalmed until one
o&rsquo;clock; and at that hour were descried from the flagship four
hostile sails, which were sailing toward her aft, with an east wind. It
was two hours before they reached the flagship, and in that space of
time the men were stationed, the ships cleared, the posts
reconnoitered, and all other arrangements made, both spiritual and
temporal, required by the occasion. The almiranta fell two ship-lengths
astern of the flagship, and in this position the ships awaited the
enemy, in order to fight them. As soon as the enemy came near, they
extended all their ships, and, without attempting to give a broadside
to our flagship, passed, in line, to larboard, and the enemy&rsquo;s
flagship began the battle by firing a cannon. Our commander immediately
commanded that response be made with two shots&mdash;one with a
thirty-pound ball and a cylinder of the same weight, which tore open
all their cutwater at the bow; the enemy&rsquo;s ship went on in this
condition, and the others continued to exchange shots with our
flagship. Recognizing their own strength, the enemy tried to approach
the almiranta, which they supposed was not so well armed, being a
smaller ship. But they were received with equal valor and spirit on our
side, our vessels firing so often and throwing so many balls that they
could not be counted. The fight lasted about five hours, and the
mortality and damage were so great that all the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>anxiety that the heretics had felt to reach our
ships when they thought to conquer us was now directed to separating
themselves from us. They anxiously awaited the night, which was now
approaching, to make their cowardly escape, which they did with lights
extinguished. But the enemy&rsquo;s almiranta did not succeed in doing
this in safety. It had been the most persistent in the attack upon our
flagship, and remained to our leeward; it was so badly damaged that its
cannon could not be fired, and hardly could it flee. Our ship was so
near it that our commander had the men ready at the bow to board the
Dutch ship; but the darkness of night forced us to abandon the chase,
on account of the danger from the shoals which the pilots declared were
in that place.</p>
<p>It was noticed that the enemy did not use lanterns as they had
formerly done, seeking protection for their armada. Our commander
ordered that they be used in our ships, and that the lights be allowed
to shine very brightly, in order that the enemy might come to look for
us. Our people fully intended to renew the pursuit at daybreak, to
finish their defeat; but when day came our two galleons found
themselves alone, and did not know what course the enemy had taken.
They followed the Dutch, in the direction which they thought most
probable, as far as Cape Bojeador, which is at the farthest end of this
island of Manila. From there our ships returned, as the coasts were now
secure, to the port of Bolinao, in order to send to this city
despatches announcing the result of the battle. This was regarded as a
brilliant victory, not only because of the disparity in the number of
ships, but because of the little damage our side had sustained. In that
battle not a man was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234"
name="pb234">234</a>]</span>killed, and comparatively few were wounded.
It was evident that the enemy&rsquo;s loss was great, although we could
not then ascertain it correctly; but afterwards we learned that many
had been killed and wounded, and that two of their vessels were
rendered useless.</p>

<h3 class="main">10. <i>Second and Third Battles</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our squadron took some rest at the port of Bolinao,
and while there it received orders to sail to the Embocadero and there
await and escort the galleon &ldquo;San Luis,&rdquo; which was expected
from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Our ships set sail, and, after encountering
many calms and head-winds, made port on the first of June, in the
island of Ticao,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2487src" href="#xd21e2487"
name="xd21e2487src">9</a> within sight of the Embocadero.</p>
<p>About this time news came to this city from the forts at Samboanga,
that the enemy with ten vessels, was at that place, and it was known
that they came intending to attack again the fort at Jol&ograve;,
which, the previous year, they had attacked with three vessels, at the
instigation and with the aid of some native insurgents. It was
gallantly defended by its governor, Captain and Sargento-mayor Estevan
de Ugalde y Orella (a brother of our commander-in-chief), who with the
aid and succor that came to him from the forts of Samboanga under
command of the governor there, Don Francisco de Atienza y
Iba&ntilde;es, compelled the Dutch to raise the siege, and to retreat
as fugitives to their ships&mdash;our people pursuing them until they
drove out the Dutch from that country <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>and sea. For that
reason the enemy returned this year with three times as great a force;
but their plans were frustrated, because at that very time orders had
been sent to withdraw honorably that garrison, for pressing reasons of
convenience which existed therefor, in regard to his Majesty&rsquo;s
service. Seeing, therefore, that they had nothing to do in Jolo, and
that in Samboanga our forces gave them as little opportunity to
accomplish anything of importance, they undertook to push forward the
completion of the other projects which they were engaged in by orders
from Jacatra. As the chief of these was the one regarding the
Embocadero, they made their appearance there on the twenty-second of
June, when one of our sentinels reported seven ships, which were
heading toward the port in which our two galleons were anchored. With
gallant resolution, our commander immediately gave orders to weigh
anchor and go out to meet them; but afterward, when he complied with
the obligation resting on the general commanders of fleets and armies,
which is on such occasions to hold a council, it was decided therein
that it would be more proper to let the enemy waste [their powder], and
not to engage in battle with them until the galleon should arrive from
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a with succor, for which they were waiting, or until
it should make some other port in safety. The port in which the ships
were anchored lies open to the sea, in the form of a semicircle, and is
entered by a passage through which vessels can go only one after
another; and this entrance was guarded by our two galleons, to prevent
the heretics from entering. On the twenty-third of the said month of
June, the enemy descried us with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>two of their ships, and fired
a gun to summon the others. Our ships returned the fire with two guns,
to show that it was not cowardice, but design and strategy, which made
our galleons remain at anchor. On the following day, the arrogance of
the enemy brought them nearer, and they very haughtily sailed in view
of our two ships. The squadron was composed of seven vessels, and
sixteen lanchas with their crews; they sailed down the coast of the
Embocadero, and then, returning, anchored at the very mouth of our
port, blockading it with their ships, stationed at convenient intervals
along the entire bar, so that we could not leave the harbor. On one
side of it the land formed an eminence, which, if seized by the enemy,
might cause great damage to our vessels. This fact was not overlooked
by the attention and vigilance of our commander; and he immediately
sent ashore a hundred and fifty infantrymen, under command of
Sargento-mayor Don Agustin de Zepeda, and Captain Gaspar Cardoso as his
subordinate, to fortify that point. This was done at once, and was a
very important measure; for at ten o&rsquo;clock at night the enemy
sent four armed lanchas to that point to reconnoiter the port. Our
soldiers, who were cautious, but vigilant, allowed them to approach
within gun-shot, until they were embarrassed by [the approach to] land,
and gave them a volley, which caused them to retreat hurriedly, with
the loss of several men who were killed. Every day, not once but often,
these lanchas sallied out to reconnoiter us&mdash;their ten challenging
our two vessels, which always went out against them, and always
remained victorious, because, as soon as they saw our vessels approach,
they always retreated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>toward their own ships. If our
vessels pursued them, one of their ships would come forward to protect
the lanchas. Thirty-one days passed in these man&oelig;uvers. One day,
our lanchas having sailed out, as usual, to reconnoiter, our people saw
the heads of some men who were swimming from the enemy&rsquo;s ships to
ours. At first it was feared that they were daring Dutchmen bent upon
burning our galleons; but soon all doubt was over, for it was found
that they were a negro and four of our Indians whom the enemy had
captured and who were coming as fugitives to gain their freedom. They
were taken aboard the flagship, where the negro was known; he gave a
very clear account of the plans of Antonio Camb, who, as he said, was
the commander of the Dutch fleet. He also said that other squadrons
were coming to join this one in raids on these islands; that this one
had brought from Jacatr&aacute; eight hundred Dutch soldiers; and that
the said Dutch commander had promised to carry back to his governor the
relief ship which was coming from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. He said that
among the seven vessels two, which were the smallest, were fireships;
that the flagship was as large as ours, or larger; that it carried
forty-six pieces of excellent artillery; and, as for the other vessels,
the smallest carried thirty cannon, and already they considered us as
their booty.</p>
<p>This information was of no little importance, and threw light upon
what should be done. On the twenty-first of July our commander,
considering that it was now time for the ship &ldquo;San Luis,&rdquo;
which was expected from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, to have made port in some
one of the many harbors that these islands contain, decided to set sail
at dawn on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>twenty-fifth, the day of the glorious apostle
Santiago [<i>i.e.</i>, St. James], to cannonade the enemy in the midst
of his fleet, and to challenge him to battle. In order to do this
without the enemy knowing his intention beforehand, he gave orders two
days previously that the anchors should be gradually raised, so that on
the eve of St. James&rsquo;s day each galleon should remain held by one
anchor only. These arrangements having been made, the enemy, who also
must have thought that it was getting late, fired a salute on the same
day of St. James&rsquo;s eve&mdash;the flagship firing five cannon, and
the almiranta, and the vice-admiral&rsquo;s ship, each two guns. The
squadron weighed anchor and took the route for Manila.</p>
<p>Our commander was much grieved that his plans should be frustrated
by the enemy, and gallantly set out in pursuit of them, determined to
force them to fight, wherever he might encounter them. He regarded
himself as fortunate when, on the twenty-eighth of July, he sighted two
of the seven [Dutch] vessels above mentioned. When they recognized our
galleons, like cowards they backed toward the land, in search of the
five ships which were out of sight. During the rest of the day, and all
night, our ships continued to approach them; and at daybreak on the
twenty-ninth we discovered all seven of their ships together, who were
coming from the windward side to look for us. At midday they halted,
and again they tacked in another direction, until five o&rsquo;clock in
the afternoon&mdash;when our commander, unable to endure such delay,
challenged them to battle by firing a cannon.</p>
<p>Apparently they did not wish to fight by day, but thought the night
more suitable for their design, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239"
href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>which was to send their two
fireships against our galleons. At that time, the nights were very
clear and calm, and the moon shone brightly. They waited, then, until
sunset; and about seven o&rsquo;clock, between Banton and Marinduque,
they came down with an east wind ahead of our flagship, and surrounded
it, the fearful multitude of their artillery filling it [with balls].
Our flagship also did its duty, responding to them as they deserved.
Our almiranta followed in its wake firing the artillery at its prow,
and inflicting much damage on the ships that were fighting astern of
our flagship. The enemy&rsquo;s flagship came up with ours, to the
sound of loud clarions and trumpets, and well garnished with lanterns
of various sizes, all lighted. Its sails were so trimmed as to let it
go no faster than our flagship, as arrogantly as if they had already
conquered us. It came so near that our men heard distinctly the noise
made when our ball hit the side of the enemy&rsquo;s ship. From both
sides there was an incessant fire of both artillery and musketry, from
the maintops, forecastles, and poops. In both the Dutch and the Spanish
ships were seen heaps of cannon-balls, cylinders, and
palanquins,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2511src" href="#xd21e2511" name=
"xd21e2511src">10</a> which caused great destruction of masts, yards,
and rigging, and even damaged the sides of the vessels. The battle went
on, as keenly and fiercely as might be expected from our persistent
valor and the great strength of the enemy. At the height of the battle
our flagship, undertaking to bear down upon two ships that were hard
pressed, found itself entangled with their almiranta, and this was the
greatest danger that had arisen, on account of the ease with which the
enemy could then work <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>havoc among our men. The brave
mariners came to the rescue, cutting the ropes and separating the
galleons, with great courage and promptness. Meanwhile, our artillery
and musketry kept up an incessant fire on the enemy&rsquo;s sides,
which were unprotected&mdash;displaying as much dexterity and order in
their firing as they could have done if the galleons were apart. It
pleased God, through the agency of His glorious mother, that the ships
should quickly separate. Then one of their fireships approached our
flagship; but our artillery checked this rash boldness, hurling at the
fireship terrible volleys on the starboard quarter until it came under
the stern-gallery of our flagship. Then our commander gave orders to
attack it with the stern-chasers, which pierced the enemy from side to
side, and with such volleys of musketry that the heretics became
demoralized and retired toward our almiranta, which received the
fireship with a volley from ten guns at once, so opportunely that its
destruction was completed; for its fireworks being thus kindled, it was
sent to the bottom. Soon came the lancha from our flagship&mdash;which
our commander, with military foresight, had equipped with musketeers
and seamen, to hinder the fireships&mdash;and picked up a Dutchman, the
only one left alive. This man informed us of the enemy&rsquo;s plans,
and of their signals, and said that they had another fireship&mdash;his
statements entirely agreeing with those of the captives already
mentioned. This fierce and stubborn battle lasted from seven
o&rsquo;clock in the evening until daybreak, without the loss of a
single man on our flagship, and only two wounded; the almiranta did not
lose over five men killed. This must be one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>of
the most unusual records known in naval warfare; it was a favor,
evident beyond doubt, from God and His mother, who protect the Catholic
power in these islands, on account of its importance to the propagation
of His holy faith. The damage sustained by the heretics was well
understood from the care with which they began to retreat as soon as
daylight came. The whole day was spent by both sides in cleaning and
repairing their vessels; but the enemy continued to retreat. Although
our commander gave orders to summon them again to battle, by
discharging a gun, and began to bear down upon them, they made no
reply.</p>
<p>Two days afterwards, on July 31&mdash;a day consecrated to the
glorious patriarch St. Ignatius de Loyala, founder of the Society of
Jesus&mdash;our commander trusting to the fact that the saint was his
countryman and patron, besought him, with ardent faith, to further, as
a matter of justice, the accomplishment of the hopes which we based
upon his patronage. Finding that he was sailing with a north wind, to
windward of the enemy, our commander, with eager courage, ordered all
sails to be spread, and started in pursuit of the enemy; he soon
overtook the Dutch ships between the island of Maesse de Campo<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2523src" href="#xd21e2523" name=
"xd21e2523src">11</a> and Mindoro, At two o&rsquo;clock on the same
day, he courageously forced our two galleons among the six vessels of
the enemy, and another horrible battle was fought. The artillery was
all fired as often and as skilfully as musketry could have been used.
The enemy attacked our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=
"#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>almiranta, but it defended itself
and assailed the enemy so bravely that it inspired fear and
astonishment. Our flagship was so veritable a volcano that no vessel
dared to give her a broadside. The enemy&rsquo;s flagship attempted to
do so, but was so badly damaged that it had to retreat, setting more
than twenty men to work the pumps; but, finding it impossible to keep
afloat, they raised a piece of canvas in our sight, a sign that she was
in great danger of sinking. Throughout the afternoon the fight
continued with the same obstinacy and vigor, with the determination on
our part not to stop until we should reduce the enemy&rsquo;s ships to
splinters, or send them to the bottom. The heretics made their last
effort by attempting to send close to our flagship their second
fireship, which was large enough to carry thirty cannon; it was
escorted by two other ships and towed by some lanchas. Our commander,
as one so experienced in military affairs, ordered the musketeers to
fire on the men who were directing the lanchas, and at the same time,
the artillery on the starboard from which the fireship was coming, to
fire at its sides; the guns on the lookout and the poop were fired with
such effect that the vessel quickly sank in sight of all, listing to
port and going down bow first. The heretics were so badly beaten and
cowed that, spreading all their canvas, they basely fled toward the
land. Our squadron followed in pursuit, but as night was approaching,
and there was a squally wind from the northwest, accompanied by thunder
and lightning, the enemy escaped by spreading their canvas aft and
extinguishing their lights.</p>
<p>This signal and miraculous event was attributed by our commander and
by the entire armada to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>special patronage of the blessed
Virgin of the Rosary and to the glorious Viscayan St. Ignatius, in
whose names the cannon-shots on our side piously succeeded one another,
that day. The disastrous rout of the enemy was publicly known, and our
victory was proclaimed all the more by their cowardly flight. The
losses on our side were as insignificant in this as in the previous
battle; and, in both, the courage, spirit, and skill of our
men&mdash;leaders, captains, pilots, and private persons&mdash;was very
great, as was evident in the result. By their ignominious flight the
insolent heretics left our coasts free, and departed from the islands
well sheared by the Embocadero, where they had come for wool, or for
the money brought from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a for our relief.</p>
<p>The governor and captain-general, Don Diego Faxardo, was informed of
all this; and by his orders our armada retired to the port of Cabite in
the latter part of August, after a six months&rsquo; voyage, in such
need of repairs as can well be imagined from the foregoing account of
the three battles. As soon as they landed, all our men marched with
their commander to the church of the glorious patriarch St. Dominic, to
return humble and tender thanks to the blessed Virgin of the Rosary for
victories so signal.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">11. <i>Second armada, and its battles</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About this time the galleon &ldquo;San Diego,&rdquo;
recently built, sailed from this port for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.
Regarding it as certain that the coasts were clear of enemies, the
authorities did not carry out their first intention of sending our
armada to escort the &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; as far as the Embocadero.
But, as the enemy had so many squadrons (as I mentioned at the outset),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>it happened, a few days later, that our galleon,
having left the port, found itself, while still in sight of Mariveles
near an islet called Fortun, at nightfall near a Dutch ship, one of
three that were in that quarter; these were part of the third squadron,
which had come to join the twelve ships of the two squadrons before
mentioned. As the commanders of these ships did not know what had
happened to the others, they dared to await the fleet thus near Manila.
Our galleon carried her guns on the ballast and the various decks were
littered with boxes and utensils, as is usually the case when one of
those ships sails on so long a voyage. The enemy recognized, at once,
that our vessel was not a warship and attacked it furiously. They
approached so close that the conversation of various persons could be
heard, but they did not venture to board the galleon; for General
Christoval Marquez de Valen&ccedil;uela, commander of the galleon, a
brave and experienced soldier, hurriedly disencumbered five iron
cannon, and, bringing them to bear on the enemy, stood on the
defensive. That action was sufficient to secure his retreat toward
Mariveles; entering the bay, with the loss of a few killed, he arrived
at the port of Cavite and made a report of the occurrence.</p>
<p>This new accident did not depress the brave heart of his Lordship
[the governor]; he ordered that the two strong galleons should be
immediately prepared to go out again, in convoy of this third one. As
promptness was so important in this matter, his Lordship, recognizing
the energy and ability of his sargento-mayor and commander of infantry,
Manuel Estacio Venegas, ordered him to proceed in person to the port of
Cavite to despatch the galleons. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>task he performed
admirably, for by his efforts there was accomplished in one week what
by other methods would have seemed much to do in a month.</p>
<p>His Lordship had previously rewarded General Lorenzo de Orella y
Ugalde with one of the best encomiendas in these islands and he
therefore, on this second occasion, appointed Admiral Sebastian Lopez
commander-in-chief of the armada, and Sargento-mayor Don Agustin de
Zepeda admiral&mdash;thus rewarding these officers for their
achievements in the first fight by giving them the highest rank in the
second one. To Captain Don Francisco Roxo was given the post of
sargento-mayor, and Captains Salvador Perez and Felipe Camino were
placed in command of the infantry companies on the flagship, and Juan
de Mora and Francisco Lopez Ynoso on the almiranta. An excellent galley
was also equipped with a cannon amidships, carrying a thirty-five pound
ball, and small culverins [<i lang="es">moyanas</i>] carrying
fourteen-pound balls; it contained also an infantry company of one
hundred picked men. Admiral Francisco de Esteyvar, commander of his
Lordship&rsquo;s company of arquebusiers, was made commander of this
galley. He was a soldier of well known bravery and experience, and as
admiral, a post which he held in these islands, he showed himself a
match for the Dutch, in carrying the relief to the forts of Terrenate.
The galley was also accompanied by four brigantines of good capacity,
well equipped with musketry, and each carrying a cannon at the prow;
Captains Don Juan de Valderrama, Juan Martinez Capelo, Don Gabriel
Mi&ntilde;o de Guzman, and Francisco de Bargas Machuca were
respectively in command of these vessels. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>The chaplains of the
fleet were: on the flagship, two friars of the Order of St. Dominic; on
the almiranta, two of the Order of St. Francis; and on the galley, one
of the order of the glorious St. Augustine. By order of his Lordship
the vow which had been made in the first expedition, of a magnificent
festival to the Virgin of the Rosary, was renewed; and the devotion was
continued of reciting aloud prayers every day, in concert, all kneeling
before the image of that sovereign lady.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of September the three galleons,
&ldquo;Encarnacion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rosario,&rdquo; and &ldquo;San
Diego,&rdquo; sailed from the harbor of Cabite, accompanied by the
fleet of oared vessels formed by the galley and the four brigantines
aforesaid. Continuing their voyage, they arrived at Fortun and saw,
toward a point called Calavite,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2556src"
href="#xd21e2556" name="xd21e2556src">12</a> on the island of Mindoro,
three of the enemy&rsquo;s ships under sail. Our brave commander was
glad of the opportunity and at once invited them to fight by firing a
few cannon. The heretics did not dare to measure their forces at close
range with ours; nor was the wind favorable for our galleons to sail in
among those of the enemy. This gallant war was therefore waged with the
artillery of longest range, the conflict lasting from four
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon until nine at night. At that hour our
almiranta&mdash;either because it was swifter, or because it was
carried on by some current&mdash;found itself in the midst of the
enemy&rsquo;s three ships, and fought with them a furious battle,
lasting four long hours&mdash;doing considerable damage to the enemy
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>being itself not a little injured as to masts,
rigging, and sails. Admiral Don Agustin de Cepeda showed himself, on
this occasion, as brave in sustaining the combat as he was skilful in
engaging the enemy. In the thick of the fight he ordered the artillery
to stop firing. The enemy taking this for a sign of weakness, their
vessels came very close to our ship on both sides, in order to vanquish
it; then our almiranta reopened fire with her artillery on both sides,
so vigorously that the enemy, unable to endure it, basely retreated. As
soon as the sun rose, our flagship bore down upon the enemy and offered
fight. But the foe, who had more need for repairs than desire to fight
again, put in at a place near Calavite point whence he had sailed,
among some shoals where our galleys could not follow.</p>
<p>Our commander then decided to continue the voyage, to furnish an
escort for the galleon &ldquo;San Diego.&rdquo; But, as it was a
recently-built vessel, and had not yet been tested, it was soon
discovered that it did not answer its helm, or carry its sails well.
As, too, the vendabals had now ended, and the north winds prevailed,
which are unfavorable for a voyage to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, General
Sebastian Lopez, in accordance with the opinion of a council called for
this purpose, decided that the galleon &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; should
put in at Mariveles, and remain until his Lordship could be informed of
the matter and despatch new orders. The &ldquo;San Diego,&rdquo; then,
anchored off Mariveles, and our flagship remained outside, held by one
anchor, since the almiranta was carried far to leeward by the currents;
and its efforts to join the flagship were unavailing, for in those
places the force of the currents is irresistible. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>The enemy, being on the alert, knew that our vessels were far from
one another; and at daybreak on October 4, the day of the seraphic
patriarch [<i>i.e.</i>, St. Francis of Assisi], they bore down on our
flagship with their three ships. The commander gallantly decided not to
leave his station, for, if he did so, the currents would carry him too
far to leeward, as they had the almiranta, and would leave the passage
open for the enemy to attack the galleon &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; (which
was still in sight), and thus deprive us of the glory and satisfaction
of all the previous victories. For this reason he decided to await,
still anchored, the three ships of the enemy, until, coming up with
him, they should begin to attack us; and then, slackening the cable
with a buoy, and unfurling the sails, he began at the same time to
discharge his artillery. Finding himself master of the situation, in
the midst of the three vessels, he fought a hot battle, which lasted
during four long hours&mdash;with little damage on our side, since only
four men were killed; while the enemy&rsquo;s loss was so great that,
as on previous occasions, they were obliged to make a dishonorable
retreat.</p>
<p>The wind then subsided, and Admiral Francisco de Esteyvar availed
himself of the opportunity to approach the enemy with his galley; and,
pointing his prow against the enemy&rsquo;s stern, opened fire against
them with cannon and culverins, and raked the vessels so furiously that
the enemy regarded themselves as lost and the men attempted to throw
themselves overboard. But soon the sea-breeze arose, and the enemy lost
their fears; and our hope of securing so valuable a prize vanished.
Notwithstanding, the result might be considered very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>fortunate, and the exploit so daring that it
bordered on rashness&mdash;for it is well known from experience that
galleys are in such encounters exposed to great risk. On this occasion,
although the enemy&rsquo;s flagship was supported by a ship on each
side, and all of them were firing terrible volleys at once, not a
single person was killed on our galley, which seems miraculous. Our
commander, seeing that the enemy were retreating, followed them all
that night, with lighted lanterns; but, as usual, they fled with their
lights put out. In this sixth fight, our arms came out with the same
reputation and splendor as in the others.</p>
<p>All these exploits are worthy of great praise, this last one no less
than those preceding, considering the circumstances; and in all these
shines brightly the favor of Heaven toward our people. According to the
estimate made by well informed persons, although we fired, in these
battles, over two thousand cannon-shots, and the enemy over five
thousand, we had only fourteen killed, and comparatively few wounded;
while the enemy, besides the vessels which we sank, arrived at their
forts so damaged, and had lost so many men, that for many a year they
will remember the two stout galleons of Manila. Nor will they forget
the gallantry, courage, and experience, and the excellent arrangements
of their generals, captains, officers and other men who took part in
this fight under orders of the governor and captain-general Don Diego
Faxardo y Chacon, whom God protect.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving [for this victory] was celebrated by a solemn
fiesta&mdash;a procession, divine worship, and [a parade of] the
squadron, with other demonstrations<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250"
href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>&mdash;in fulfilment of the
vow made to the Virgin of the Rosary, the city making a new vow to
continue this anniversary every year.</p>
<p>These exploits are all successful, and with them we might have
congratulated ourselves on having maintained our good fortune on the
sea, if our success against the enemy&rsquo;s guns had also marked our
conflict with the elements. The galleon &ldquo;San Luis,&rdquo;
commanded by General Fernando Lopez Perona, left Acapulco late in the
season and encountered the vendavals so prevalent in these islands that
before land was sighted it passed through fierce tempests, lost its
masts, and finally made the unlucky port of Cagayan. There, driven by
the currents, it struck on the rocks and was torn open at the
keel&mdash;not before, however, the commander had placed in safety the
men, and the registered silver (which is the most essential part of the
succor sent), and afterward removed the artillery. Nevertheless, the
loss is great, owing to the lack of vessels on these islands at
present, the many failures [which it occasioned] to business men, and
the lawsuits to which such disasters give rise. It cost no less than
the life of the commander, who died in that same city of Cagayan a few
days after his arrival&mdash;giving up his life, as a proof of his
honorable devotion and of his zeal in fulfilling his duties in the
service of the king and the welfare of the colony.</p>
<p>After this event, and after the aforesaid battles and victories, our
armada retired to the port of Cavite for necessary repairs. The
galleons were already in the shipyard when the heretical Corsairs again
appeared on the coast with three ships. They had captured a rich
Chinese vessel of large size; and they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>thought best not to
destroy it, but to send it to Jacatra intact. Twenty soldiers were
placed aboard it, in charge of an officer, and fifty of the Chinese
traders and mariners who came in it were left to work the ship; while
the rest of the Chinese, with some Indians whom they held as captives,
were set free and put ashore. The Chinese traders who were left on
board managed so well that before they cleared the coast, they seized a
suitable opportunity to turn against the Dutch, and killed them all;
and they brought the vessel to this city, where they were received with
great applause and general satisfaction. And, to crown our joy more
fully, it pleased God that the pirates should depart&mdash;either
driven by unfavorable winds or constrained by some other
accident&mdash;and leave free passage to the Chinese. They, since
December, when this occurred, until May of 647, the time of this
writing, have continued their voyages to Manila as usual&mdash;although
with fewer vessels and less merchandise than formerly, on account of
the wars of invasion in that great monarchy, which has been almost
conquered and subdued by the Eastern Tartars. According to information
in letters of February and March of this year, received in this city
from trustworthy persons, and the statements of the Chinese themselves,
who arrive here with their hair cut in the fashion of the Tartars, the
natives offer but little resistance.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">Manila and Cavite are prepared, and the Dutch
arrive</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As the haughty heretic had not shown himself on these
coasts during the months of April and May of this year, some believed
that he was so severely punished, and even weakened, by the encounters
and battles of the previous year, that they declared he would not dare
return this year to molest these islands. But although it may be the
fixed rule of the good soldier always to suppose the worst, Don Diego
Faxardo, governor and captain-general of these islands, with his
caution and long experience, determined that all precautions should be
taken as if it were certain that the enemy would come to Manila this
year, and with a greater force than before. To this end, in the council
which was called for the despatch of the relief ships from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, opinions agreed that, for this year, only one vessel
should sail; and order was given that the building of another ship
should be completed as speedily as possible in the shipyard in the
islands of Leyte; and that in the port of Cabite the galleons, galleys,
and other vessels there should be repaired. He ordered his
sargento-mayor and commander of the garrison in Manila, who has in
charge the fortifications, to exert every effort and spare no expense
in making the walls of the city impregnable. The royal cavalier of San
Diego, which commands the bay and that part of the shore which would be
most dangerous [in case of attack], has been finished; it is truly a
regal work, and the largest of its kind that has been seen in these
parts. In like manner the ramparts are going up on both sides
[<i>i.e.</i>, sea and land], causing general surprise and admiration
that so great a work <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254"
name="pb254">254</a>]</span>can be carried on, without special cost or
oppression to the colony, and with economy of the royal funds. The
artillery was brought from Cagayan and other places, and provisions and
ammunition were continually collected and stored; and finally his
Lordship appointed a general, admiral, and other officers, that he
might in any emergency have ready for immediate use as large a naval
force as possible, in order to go out with it against the enemy. The
condition of affairs, limited means, and lack of supplies, and above
all the destitution of the natives in such calamitous times, prevented
his Lordship, as regards the Armada, from giving to it his close
attention. It therefore resulted that at the beginning of June,
although men were at work on all of the vessels, only one galleon and
two galleys were ready. On the ninth of the said month, the feast of
the Holy Spirit [<i>i.e.</i>, Pentecost], the commander of a champan
which had gone with an armed guard, to carry twelve thousand pesos from
the royal treasury to the presidio of Oton for the relief of Terrenate,
came to port, and said that he was fleeing from three vessels of high
freeboard which he had sighted near Luban, and he had fought with their
lanches. On the afternoon of the same day this information was
verified, for several vessels were seen to enter through the channels
of Mariveles. His Lordship ordered that despatches be instantly sent to
the alcaldes-mayor and military officers along the coast, so that they
could be on their guard, and, besides, warn those who were sailing [in
those waters], especially the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de
Guia,&rdquo; which was on her way from the Leyte shipyard; and so
diligently was this latter commission executed that the warning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>thus given enabled that galleon to elude the
enemy. So important is it to have an officer who is faithful and
diligent in carrying out the orders of his commander-in-chief. Two
hundred Spanish infantry belonging to the garrison of this city marched
to the port of Cabite well supplied with gunpowder and other munitions.
With them was General Don Pedro de Almonte Verastegui, who had been
selected for commander of the Armada on account of his high standing
and distinguished services in the highest positions in these islands;
Admiral Don Andres Axcueta, heir to the valor and services of his
father, Master-of-camp Christoval de Axcueta Menchaca, who went as
commander of the troops who were to aid the naval force; Captain Don
Lope de Colindres, commander of the galleon &ldquo;San Andres;&rdquo;
Don Pedro de Figueroa, sargento-mayor of the armada; and others,
gentlemen and half-pay officers, who arrived at the port at dawn on the
second day of the festival.</p>
<p>After the sun rose, eleven of the enemy&rsquo;s vessels were seen
half-way up the bay. General Andres Lopez de Azaldiqui was castellan
and chief magistrate of that military post, as also of the royal
galleys. During the past year, when the general public was feeling
least anxiety about enemies his solicitude and care had led him to
construct several defenses which were very important. There was a
palisade of heavy timbers, and a parapet, with earthworks and gabions,
with their platforms, on the side next the bay, which was the most
exposed and defenseless position. Other palisades and fortifications
were constructed in the village of the Indians, and in other places.
Additional sentinels and guards were stationed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>along the beach and in the open country. His
great prudence was made evident when, on the said day of the feast, the
news arrived, and the ships of the enemy&rsquo;s fleet began to come in
sight. The call to arms was immediately sounded in the port; the posts
and vessels were manned by Spanish infantry, and the shore, from San
Roque to what is called Estan&ccedil;uela, by Japanese and Indians, as
assistants to the Spaniards; and a patrol was formed of horsemen who
were hastily summoned from the neighboring ranches.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Battle of Cabite, and other events up to the time when
the armada was divided</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Between nine and ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning the
heretics, leaving two ships to guard the entrances of Mariveles,
proceeded with the nine others to the port of Cabite. Between ten and
eleven o&rsquo;clock they arrived within a gunshot of the land, the
drums beating on the flagship, and the entire squadron making a fine
display. Seeing the enemy within range, it was thought best to favor
him with some shots, which were fired from the towers and platforms
near by. The shots must have taken effect, for the flagship turned
away, and directed its course seaward; and it fired a single
cannon-shot&mdash;apparently to summon a patache which, going somewhat
ahead, approached the shore, sounding the port and reconnoitering the
vessels. The enemy went on to Pampanga, where they amused themselves
until the following day, the last of the festival; then they returned
to Cabite with ten ships. At nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, they
anchored off the point called Punta del Sangley, at a legua from shore.
When the moon had almost set <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>an attempt was made by the enemy
to reconnoiter the coast in that quarter with three lanchas; but the
sentinels and patrols, who were forewarned, did not permit this. That
night the fortifications were strengthened, two platforms were added,
and other desirable precautionary and defensive measures were
taken.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, June 12, the ten vessels and a champan were
anchored in the same place; and at eight o&rsquo;clock, two others
appeared, coming under full sail from Mariveles. As soon as these were
close to the enemy, the flagship weighed anchor, and the entire
squadron sailed after it in line, making a beautiful sight, until they
came within gunshot of the port, and abreast of the tower on the new
gate, where a white flag with the royal arms was displayed; the
flagship lowered its flag and maintopsail to half mast, and hoisted it
again to the sound of drums and fifes. The fight at once began with the
discharge of artillery from this tower, which was in charge of
Sargento-mayor Don Pedro de Figueroa. The enemy responded with a
furious volley, and boldly venturing into the harbor, anchored their
six largest vessels at a suitable distance for bombarding our vessels,
forts, and settlement; the other six vessels, with their sails trimmed
to the wind, sailed to and fro, briskly skirmishing. Both sides fought
sharply and incessantly, for eight hours, from eleven o&rsquo;clock
until almost seven in the evening. According to the count of our
captain of artillery, one thousand eight hundred cannon-shots were
fired by our side, and by the enemy over three thousand. Our fire was
effective, for two Dutch prisoners, who were on the enemy&rsquo;s
flagship during the battle, deposed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>that the ship was
struck by over one hundred and twenty balls, some of them piercing the
hull through and through; others struck at the water-line, making so
large a hole that it was necessary to get assistance from the other
vessels to repair the damage. It is considered certain that if the
flagship had not been anchored&mdash;and even run aground, as many
say&mdash;she would have gone to the bottom. As many as thirty men were
killed on that ship. If this vessel, which is the strongest in the
whole squadron, and best equipped with guns&mdash;carrying twenty-four
cannon, in two tiers, on each side&mdash;was so badly damaged, from
this it may be inferred the loss to the other ships, as compared with
this one. The champan which accompanied the enemy&rsquo;s ships was a
fireship, intended to set fire to our squadron. It approached very near
ours, so that we heard their talk; and we noticed some unbecoming
actions, with which they enraged us. But soon their insolence was
repaid, one of the cannon-balls hitting their ship and kindling the
fire-devices that it contained, which consumed it without doing any
harm to our vessels. The balls discharged by the enemy were so
numerous, that they fell like hailstones; they weighed thirty or
thirty-five libras, and from that down&mdash;some were of forty libras,
but the greater number of ten or twelve, besides bar-shot, cylinders,
and <i lang="es">lanternas</i> [fireballs?]; and it seems a miracle
that they caused us so little damage.</p>
<p>Our galleon &ldquo;San Diego,&rdquo; which carried the colors as
flagship, and faced the enemy, received over two hundred cannon-balls,
but not one penetrated her hull, and only two men were killed&mdash;one
a Spaniard, on the poop; and the other an Indian, in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>ship&rsquo;s waist. The commodore&rsquo;s galley
was hit more than thirty times, but only one Spanish soldier and seven
galley-slaves were killed; the second galley lost two men, and the
other vessel at a similar rate. Almost every roof on house and church,
in the Spanish town, was damaged, and many shots took effect on the
cathedral. One, an eighteen-libra ball, went through the main entrance,
and hit a pillar of the large chapel, passing over the head of a child,
who fortunately remained uninjured. In the convent of St. Francis over
thirty balls were picked up; in that of St. Dominic, six; in the
residence of the Society of Jesus, nine; in the government storehouses,
seventy-four. Notwithstanding, there was not in any house, convent, or
church a single person killed or wounded; and the entire number of
killed and injured in all the vessels and military posts during this
engagement, did not exceed five Spaniards and four Indians killed, and
eight Spaniards and one Indian wounded, who all together did not equal
the number of killed on the enemy&rsquo;s flagship alone.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2656src" href="#xd21e2656" name="xd21e2656src">1</a>
This good fortune was due, in the first place, to the mercy and
protection of heaven, besought by the prayers and supplications offered
in all of the churches&mdash;in Cabite, the city of Manila, and other
places all along this bay from which the battle could be seen and
heard&mdash;while the blessed sacrament was exposed. In the second
place, to the promptness and speed with which, by the orders of his
Lordship and the energy of the sargento-mayor and garrison commander,
Manuel Estacio Vanegas, re&euml;nforcements <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>[and
supplies] were sent from Manila. Much also was due to the excellent
arrangements, the courage, and personal supervision of everything by
the governor of the military post, General Andres Lopez de Azaldigui;
also to the bravery, spirit, gallantry, and military experience of the
chiefs and captains in charge of the different posts: General Don Pedro
de Almonte, as commander of the armada&mdash;the vessels on sea, and
the Arsenal on shore; Admiral Don Andres Axcueta, in command of the
galleon &ldquo;San Diego,&rdquo; which displayed the colors as
flagship; Sargento-mayor Don Pedro de Figueroa, Captain Don Lope de
Colindres, and other captains and officers in charge of the ramparts,
towers, and bastions. Especially [praise is due] to the commander of
the principal fortress, San Felipe, over which floated the royal
standard of red damask; this was the target for innumerable shots, and,
although some perforated it, none were able to tear it down&mdash;a
sign that the victory was to remain with us. The result was, that the
enemy, who about noon had entered the harbor so daringly, were
constrained to retire at midnight. The next day was begun, on our side,
with six cannon-shots, but the enemy did not accept our challenge, and
sailed out of the range of our forts&mdash;many lanchas carrying succor
to the flagship, from which may be inferred the great injury that it
had sustained. It is considered certain that the enemy would have
retired within a few hours after the commencement of the battle, had
the tide been favorable to the three largest vessels. During the
battle, a re&euml;nforcement of one hundred and fifty infantry, a few
pieces of artillery, and a large supply of powder were despatched from
Manila; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>and with these went several prominent persons
who asked that they might be present at the scene of battle.</p>
<p>It was considered a special favor from heaven that at the height of
the conflict, when all the enemy&rsquo;s ships were off Cabite, one of
our pataches, in command of Admiral Luis Alonso de Roa, which was
coming from the kingdom of Camboja&mdash;whither Don Luis had gone as
an envoy, in regard to establishing there a plant for building ships,
and conveying to it provisions and other supplies&mdash;entered the bay
through the smaller channel of Mariveles, and reached a place of
safety.</p>
<p>On the day after the battle, which was Thursday, June 13, the enemy
was still in the bay of Maribeles and Batan; and in the afternoon they
approached the island, and landed their men. They burned the
sentry-post, which is situated on the highest point, and established
themselves in the corregidor&rsquo;s house and in the huts of the
Indians. Then, with the aid of the vendaval, they [brought up and]
repaired two of their vessels which had come with most damage out of
the fight.</p>
<p>On Friday morning three of the vessels set sail, and, landing at a
place called Rio de Ca&ntilde;as, sent a crowd of people ashore. These
proceeded to the huts of some Sangleys who were making salt, intending
to seize some fresh food, and especially some of the cattle which
wander about those shores. But the chief commander at Cabite, being
informed of what the enemy were doing, quickly despatched a hundred
Spanish infantry, in command of Don Marcos de Zapal&aacute;,
alcalde-in-ordinary of this city, and seventy horsemen with Captain
Christoval <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=

were not so fortunate as to encounter the enemy, compelled them to
embark in haste. This they did in seven lanchas and two long-boats
abandoning on the shore one of the cattle which they had killed (which
were only two).</p>
<p>On Saturday, the boatmen on the Cabite ferry brought in a Dutch
lancha of large size, and with a mast, which was dragging its anchor
about the bay. On Tuesday, the eighteenth, two ships appeared at Punta
del Sangley at daylight, I know not with what design; but at eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning they proceeded to Bantan. On Wednesday,
the nineteenth, at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the entire
squadron assembled at the small channel of Maribeles, and after firing
a cannon at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when the moon rose, all
the twelve vessels, four of them with lighted lanterns, weighed anchor,
and sailed away through the large channel. Then they separated, six
taking their course toward the shipyard of Mindoro, and the other six,
returning on the very morning of Corpus Christi, entered the bay, and
dropped anchor in the same place from which they had sailed.</p>

<h3 class="main">Events which took place in Abucay and Samal, province
of Pampanga</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On Saturday, the twenty-second, at daybreak, the enemy
appeared close in shore off Abucay, the principal village in the
province of Pampanga. This village has a very costly substantial church
and convent, built of stone, in sight of the sea, belonging to the
fathers of St. Dominic. His Lordship the governor and captain-general,
being informed of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263"
name="pb263">263</a>]</span>this, and foreseeing the damage which might
result if the enemy should land there, ordered the alcalde-mayor of the
province to fortify the church and thwart the designs of the enemy,
with the assistance of the resident Spaniards and natives of Pampanga,
who had proved their bravery so well on all occasions. He also sent an
adjutant and other men from this city to aid them, and directed that
the money, which had been removed from a champan belonging to Chinese
traders and placed in the church to prevent it from falling in the
hands of the enemy, should be put in a safe place or be forwarded to
this city.</p>
<p>Although the alcalde-mayor<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2685src" href=
"#xd21e2685" name="xd21e2685src">2</a> had come to these islands as a
captain of infantry, he could not have been so good a soldier as he was
a trader, nor so brave in spirit as great in stature. He replied that
the place was better fortified than La Rochelle, and that if the
heretics landed there none would be left to carry the tidings back to
the vessels. He left that place on Friday, the twenty-first, leaving
there one hundred and fifty Pampango soldiers and five Spaniards, all
in command of Don Pedro Gamboa, a retired master-of-camp of the
Pampanga nation. The following day, Saturday, the six Dutch ships came
in sight off Abucay, with as many more lanchas, and sent ashore an
officer with as many as one hundred and thirty men. They entered the
village boldly, by the bridge from the landing-place, and, firing their
guns, approached the gates of the church and convent; but they were
repulsed by our men so successfully <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>that they took to
flight. They left in the court three men dead, with some firearms; and
they retreated so hastily that they jumped into the water with their
clothes and shoes on. At the same time when this was occurring in
Abucay, they also attacked Samal, the second village of the same
province, with three other lanchas, but with no better fortune; for,
when they reached the village, hardly had they set fire to the huts in
the outskirts when they were repulsed, with the same courage as at
Abucay. As soon as the enemy had gone, the master-of-camp destroyed the
bridge across a small river, over which it is necessary to cross from
the beach to the convent. He then sent a despatch to the alcalde-mayor
of the province telling what had occurred, and that it was presumed
that the pirates would return to the attack with a larger force. The
alcalde-mayor was in another village, collecting soldiers to send to
the relief of Manila; but he reached Abucay that very night, with the
recruits whom he already had and some whom he had secured from other
places. He held a consultation with the Pampango commanders as to the
measures to be taken in case the enemy should return. All were of
opinion that the convent should be fortified, and a sufficient number
of men stationed therein to defend it, and that the body of the troops
should await the Dutch in the field; and that at the landing, at the
ford of the stream, and in other places suitable for ambuscades, they
should inflict all the damage possible on the enemy. But the alcalde
thought that they should avoid shutting up themselves in the convent so
that they might be able to flee to the woods if pressed by the enemy;
accordingly, he did not submit to their opinion, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>only
defense that he made was to lock the gates of the buildings.</p>
<p>The Dutch commander piqued at the retreat, and the loss of his men,
and, it is supposed, having received information through a negro and
some Sangley fishermen that the money belonging to the traders of the
Chinese vessel which had escaped him, was concealed in the said church,
would not entrust the exploit [of seizing the money] to any one but
himself. On the following day, Sunday, he appeared at dawn on the
beach, with all of his lanchas and in view of all our men who were
inside the convent; and landed with as many as four hundred men, and
two pieces of field artillery, displaying seven ensigns. Without
meeting any opposition they marched, in order, to the stream and the
little bridge which had been destroyed by the Pampangos. The water was
deep; so, seizing some small boats belonging to the natives, which they
easily found, they coolly transported their men and guns. Our Pampangos
were burning to go forth to attack them, and were so impatient that,
had they not been restrained by their innate loyalty, they would have
turned against the alcalde.</p>
<p>After crossing the river, the general marched his troop in regular
files until he came near the court [<i lang="es">patio</i>] of the
church, which was of stone, and very suitable for defensive and even
offensive warfare. Here he halted; but quickly observing how feeble was
its defense, he entered the court, halted in front of the main entrance
of the church, and fired his artillery against it. But as his guns were
small, and the gates very strong, he could accomplish no more than to
splinter off a piece, making a hole through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>which one could hardly thrust a hand. Meanwhile,
there were volleys on both sides from the muskets and arquebuses. The
alcalde remained in the highest part of the convent; a Pampango fell
dead near him, and when he saw the latter&rsquo;s blood, his own
immediately ran cold. When he was told that the powder would soon give
out&mdash;which was quite true, for he had not brought for this
occasion all that had been sent from Manila&mdash;he left his post,
under pretext of going to consult two religious of that convent (who
were in retreat in the farthest cell, praying to God for our success),
and never returned to see what was going on; but he discussed with the
religious the desirability of displaying a flag of truce, in order to
negotiate [with the enemy] for saving our lives.</p>
<p>Among those in the convent were the principal men of all Pampanga,
many of them veteran soldiers of long experience in Terrenate. They
told the alcalde that our forces were superior in number to those of
the enemy; that on various occasions they had shown themselves equal to
the foe, and did not acknowledge him as their superior on land; and
that when their ammunition and weapons were exhausted they would hurl
themselves against him tooth and nail, and die like good soldiers,
fighting in the service of God and the king. They declared that they
would not consider a flag of peace, which would serve to encourage the
enemy and deliver them all into his hands.</p>
<p>The religious (who could have prevented what was done) supported the
opinion of the alcalde, and even tried to use their authority as
ministers to compel the Pampangos to agree with it; and, in spite of
the objections made by the Indians, they finally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>hung
out a peace-flag from one of the windows. The Dutch general was greatly
delighted, and promised favorable terms. One of the religious,
accompanied by the Spanish adjutant who was there, descended, and
conversed for a long time with the general. While this parley was going
on, the Dutchmen did not cease to try the other doors and windows of
the convent, in order to effect an entrance; nor did the Pampangos
discontinue their resistance, wounding and killing many of the enemy.
The general, irritated at this, and noticing that one of his men had
scaled the convent wall by means of a workmen&rsquo;s scaffolding, and
entering, had rung the bells as a signal of victory, said that this was
no time for treating of peace; and seizing in the crowd the negotiators
as prisoners, he commanded a renewal of hostilities, and ordered his
men to enter the church and convent on all sides. The bravest and most
prominent Pampangos defended themselves gallantly, refusing to hear any
talk of surrender to a heretical prince, although the Dutch promised to
spare their lives if they would do so. But as their weapons were
inferior [to the enemy&rsquo;s] and their powder had been exhausted,
the Pampangos were finally defeated; nearly two hundred were
barbarously put to death, and forty others together with the alcalde
and the other religious<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2710src" href=
"#xd21e2710" name="xd21e2710src">3</a> who was in the convent, were
taken prisoners. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268"
name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>To make matters worse for us and fortunate for the heretics, there
was not lacking an informer, who disclosed to the enemy the silver from
the Sangley ship, which had been hidden in a deep hole; the Dutch
carried it away, to the amount of twenty thousand pesos. They burned
the convent, and the woodwork of the church, but the fire did not
extend to the altar; and they retreated to their lanchas on the same
day, without sacking the village.</p>
<p>At the same time, another but smaller body of their troops attacked
the village of Samal; but the Pampangos who were in garrison there,
under command of Sargento-mayor Don Alexo Aguas, went out against them
and compelled them to retreat, as those in Abucay would have done if
the religious and the alcalde had allowed them to fight.</p>
<p>When the news of this affair reached Manila, it aroused unspeakable
resentment; and prompt measures were taken to avenge it. Large
re&euml;nforcements of men and ammunition were despatched under General
Juan de Chavez, a soldier of the courage and ability which the occasion
demanded.</p>
<p>The Order of St. Augustine&mdash;which maintains all the religious
ministries of Pampanga except the two at Abucay and Samal, which,
however, belong to the actual ministers of the province&mdash;was
charged to send thither other religious, of unexceptionable character.
As such, went the father master Fray Alonso de Caravajal (who was
formerly provincial), and the present prior of the Manila convent, the
father preacher Fray Diego de Tamayo. These with their discretion and
zeal, and the long experience and general popularity which they had in
that province, undertook to give it consolation. As a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>result, in less than four days six hundred
soldiers had been recruited to oppose the enemy if they should return
to make another attack&mdash;which, in fact, was made on Thursday, July
11. The enemy placed in the field two hundred and fifty men, in command
of the fiscal, who in rank is third in the armada, to pillage the
village of Abucay, and kill the cattle and swine which are usually kept
there.</p>
<p>General Juan de Chavez, who was fortified in Samal, was informed of
the attack, and despatched ahead a troop under Captain Francisco Gomez
Pulido, while he followed with the remainder of his men. They found the
enemy in the village, pillaging the houses and killing the cattle. Our
General opened fire, and made the enemy retreat toward the church;
Captain Francisco Gomez Pulido, with the force under his command, went
across the fields by another road, and the heretics were so taken by
surprise that they turned their backs and fled to their lanchas. At the
same time Adjutant Francisco Palmares arrived on the beach with another
detachment of troops from another post, and attacked the enemy,
compelling them to return to their boats through water that reached
their mouths; they left fourteen dead and two prisoners on shore. The
number of killed and wounded by the time they reached their vessels is
unknown, but it was doubtless great.</p>
<p>This good fortune, and the grants and favors conferred by the
governor, in the name of his Majesty, on the widows and orphans of the
Pampango chiefs, who had lost their lives, have somewhat mitigated the
sorrow and suffering caused by the late disaster. In order that pious
feeling should find an opportunity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270"
href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>for expression, solemn
funeral rites were celebrated in the royal chapel, by his
Lordship&rsquo;s orders, for the dead Pampangos, at which all the
Spanish and Pampango troops were present, under command of their
master-of-camp, Don Sebastian de Guzman. The Order of St. Augustine, as
the [religious] mother of that people, performed the same rites in the
convent at Manila, and in all of the others throughout their
province.</p>

<h3 class="main">Information and statements made by the prisoners of
the enemy&rsquo;s fleet</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Through the said two Dutch prisoners was obtained all
information that we desired of the enemy&rsquo;s fleet. These men
declared that they had sailed from Jacatra in Batabia, early in March,
having been despatched by Cornelio Fandelin,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2742src" href="#xd21e2742" name="xd21e2742src">4</a> governor of
that place, under command of General Martin Gercen [Gertzen?] a Frisian
by birth; and that the fleet consisted of thirteen vessels, one of
which was lost on the voyage. The voyage lasted three months, and they
halted only at Pulolaor for provisions. As for the size of the ships,
the flagship is a vessel of seven hundred toneladas; the ships of the
admiral, fiscal, and sub-fiscal, of eight hundred; and the others from
three hundred to four hundred; and the pataches from sixty to one
hundred toneladas. The flagship carries forty-eight guns: eighteen of
these are of bronze, carrying balls of eighteen, twenty-four, and
thirty-six libras; the others are of iron, with balls of nine to
fifteen libras. The almiranta, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271"
href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>and the ships of the fiscal
and sub-fiscal carried forty, thirty-eight, and thirty-six guns
respectively, some of bronze, with balls of twenty-four libras or less.
The four other ships carried thirty-libra cannon. The guns on the
pataches, some of bronze, carried balls of eighteen to twenty libras.
The flagship was also supplied with many devices for using fire, with a
German inventor who manufactures them, so that on occasion these could
be placed in some one of their smaller vessels, in order to burn our
fleet. The flagship left Batabia with two hundred and twenty men, all
white, of various European nations, unmixed with men from any of the
peoples in these regions; the almiranta and the fiscal&rsquo;s ship
carried each two hundred and ten, and the sub-fiscal&rsquo;s two
hundred; the other vessels seventy or eighty each. The flagship had
already lost from its quota seventy men, and the other vessels
proportionately, many having been killed in the fight at Cabite and in
other engagements; moreover, there is a disease, known as Verber
[<i>i.e.</i>, beri-beri], which is now prevalent throughout the fleet,
by which most of the men have been attacked. The orders carried by the
Dutch ships are, to capture the vessels coming from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
and prevent the voyage of those that must go to that kingdom for aid.
They were also to ascertain, at the same time, the condition in which
these fortified posts are, so that they can prepare for a larger fleet
to follow in the succeeding year. It was said that he who will come in
that fleet as commander is Antonio Can [<i>i.e.</i>, Caan], former
governor of Malayo, who had come last year from Olanda, and now is in
Jacatra as second in command at that place. The season here will be
favorable to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>them, as the monsoon will give them time
[enough], and their provisions will hold out; and within a month four
of the said ships will set out for the kingdom of Japon, with
merchandise which they are carrying, and will go with the proceeds to
the kingdom of Siam. Such is the information which the prisoners have
thus far given us regarding the Dutch armada; and it is confirmed from
other sources.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2759src" href="#xd21e2759"
name="xd21e2759src">5</a></p>
<p>Our armada at present is composed of three large galleons and one of
medium size, two pataches, and two galleys, with other oared vessels of
less size. All hands are at work on it, without any
cessation&mdash;with eager desires and no less assured hopes, under
God&rsquo;s favor, whose cause this is, of gaining success and good
fortune against the heretical and rebel squadron.</p>
<p>Nor can my unskilful pen rightly deny the glory of such a victory,
as of all the rest that has been thus far accomplished and is mentioned
above, to the prime mover of all the influences and actions of this
government&mdash;the sargento-mayor and governor of this garrison,
Manuel Estacio Venegas, one of the old and prominent citizens of this
city, and a brave son of the royal army at Granada. He was chosen by
Don Diego Faxardo for these and greater undertakings on account of his
honorable, successful, and extraordinary services of thirty-four years
in this region in the royal armadas of galleons and galleys, on the
Northern Sea and in these islands. In military service, he was
sargento, alf&eacute;rez, and captain of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>infantry; and in
political affairs he served as regidor of this city, and as chancellor
and registrar of the royal Audiencia&mdash;in which latter post his
Lordship found him, filling it with approval and distinction, as is
well known to all this kingdom. The victories and successes described
in these relations are due to his unwearied personal efforts in sending
out troops and supplies, and to his thorough understanding and
excellent arrangements of all matters. His courage and dexterity in
difficulties and hindrances, his subordination and military obedience,
and execution of orders given by his superiors, [are all worthy of
praise]; for ever since his Lordship placed in his charge the office of
sargento-mayor, there have been few nights which he has not passed in
the guardroom, or making the round of the city and its walls.</p>
<p>It fell to his lot to destroy such parts of the fortifications as
appeared inadequate for the defense of this post and he strengthened
the walls with new ones which, it has been said, are without doubt
impregnable. I know not which to admire most, the strength of the
fortification, or the rapidity with which the work was performed,
without any burden or injury [to the people].</p>
<p>The thorough knowledge which he had of all his officers was
doubtless the reason for the wise and fortunate selection that he made
in naming to his Lordship, the year before, the leaders who were best
qualified for positions of authority in the armadas&mdash;through which
he obtained the so glorious results which we have described, providing
the fleets with all that was necessary to gain success. The rapidity
with which he carried on the work was sufficient to make ready [for
battle] anew the two galleons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274"
href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>&ldquo;Encarnacion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rosario&rdquo; in one single week, in order that they might
convoy the galleon &ldquo;San Diego;&rdquo; they gained the third
victory, which was the complement of the others that were gained the
year before.</p>
<p>All this being known to his Lordship, as soon as the news came this
year of the enemy&rsquo;s armada he gave the sargento-mayor full and
adequate commission to arrange and order everything as should appear
best to him, in order not to delay sending aid, as occasion might
demand, not only at the storehouses but in the provinces&mdash;to which
he sent supplies with the promptness which the case required. Thus the
islands have been freed, on land and sea, from the attacks of the
enemy, and the vessels which have come to us from other lands have made
port in safety&mdash;thoroughly frustrating the designs of the
heretics. This was especially the case in the attack on Abucay, where
the sargento-mayor sent very opportune aid of men and
ammunition&mdash;so greatly to the satisfaction of the alcalde-mayor,
Diego Antonio, that he wrote to him that all was done very promptly,
and he was expecting to achieve some great exploit. If the alcalde had
carried out this promise, as he could have done, or at least had
allowed the brave Pampangos to fight, neither would the above-related
defeat have occurred, nor would the enemy have obtained any results
from their attack.</p>
<p>However, by promptly despatching General Juan de Chaves, his
vigilance and skill were able to harass the heretics&mdash;much to
their own cost, as it was not lack of foresight, but the little
military exercise in the commander of that province, which occasioned
that defeat. Finally, through the sargento-mayor&rsquo;s vigilance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>and care, and the valor of the generals and
chiefs, much has been, and we hope will be, accomplished in these
islands for the success of our arms and the reputation of this military
post&mdash;which is so destitute of aid, as being remote from his
Majesty, whom may God protect.</p>

<h2 class="main">DECREE REGARDING MISSIONARIES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The King. To Don Diego Fajardo, knight of the Order of
Santiago, member of my Council of War, and my governor and
captain-general of the Filipinas Islands: In a clause of the letter
which you wrote to me on the fifteenth of August in the past year of
six hundred and forty-five, you say that the bishop-elect of Caceres is
bringing suit against the religious of St. Francis in regard to some
mission stations which those religious have held for the past thirty
years and more; that he has asked you to aid him in taking possession
of them; and that you have delayed doing so until you could report to
me that in those islands the Indian natives are much better instructed
by the religious than by the secular priests&mdash;considering that the
latter are born in the islands, and are but few in number; and that
many of them are by their habit of life not fitted to set an example
for others, or [to carry out] what is decreed for the other parts of
the Yndias. In regard to the missions, there are in those islands
especial reasons why I should order this matter to be again considered,
on account of not having secular priests of more approved life for the
new conversions and doctrines; for since the natives of those islands
have been instructed from the beginning by religious, they are more
obedient to these. This matter having been examined in my royal Council
of the Yndias, together with the opinion thereon of my fiscal of the
Council, I have deemed it best to tell you that, in regard to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>point of furnishing aid [to the bishop], it is
your duty to consider what course you ought to pursue conformably to
[the requirements of] justice, and whether it would be just to grant
him aid according to law. You shall act accordingly in this, and in
other matters that may arise in which it may be expedient to grant aid.
In what concerns those missions which the religious may hold, you shall
observe what has been ordained by the decrees and orders that have been
issued on account of this, in all cases giving careful attention to
[the requirements] of my royal patronage, without making any change in
what has been commanded and decided in the matter. Dated at Madrid, on
the seventeenth of September in the year one thousand six hundred and

<p class="first">His sacred Majesty our king and sovereign Philipo
Second was pleased, through his most Christian and Catholic zeal, to
establish this kingdom of Philipinas and plant herein the evangelical
doctrine by means of the religious of our seraphic father St. Francis.
For this purpose his Majesty sent father Fray Pedro de Alfaro with
seventeen religious, sons of the province of San Joseph, of the
discalced religious. Thirteen of them were priests, two were choristers
and two lay-brothers. Six religious died on the voyage, but they were
joined by six more in M&eacute;xico, and they entered Manila August 2,
1577. They were lodged in a bamboo house, where the marshal Gabriel de
Ribera built a church of planks. Father Fray Pedro de Alfaro began his
ministry immediately by assigning his associates to all the provinces
of this kingdom; and they, inducing the Indians to come from the rugged
mountains and reducing them to settlements, baptized them and
instructed them in the mysteries of our holy faith, and erected
churches and laid out villages. At present the province has charge of
fifty-two villages in these islands, as follows.</p>

<h3 class="main">Hospitals</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The province, considering the great service which is
performed for our Lord in the cure of the sick, and that its
evangelical ministers ought to attend to the spiritual necessities of
all and to the corporal needs of the poor, began to establish some
hospitals in this new [field of the] conversion, entrusting so
apostolic a ministry to a lay-brother of proved virtue called Fray Juan
Clemente. That religious, with singular charity, collected some alms
among the Spaniards, and began to treat the poor Spaniards in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>a wretched nipa house. Since the order of our
father St. Francis may not hold property and have the management of
money, therefore that hospital, like the others founded by the
province, was placed under the royal protection. God took to himself a
Spaniard who had one of the best cattle-ranches in this kingdom. That
Spaniard made confession and deposited his will with father Fray
Agust&iacute;n de Tordesillas, one of the first founders of this
province. Father Fray Agust&iacute;n counseled that Spaniard to leave
his ranch to the royal hospital of the Spaniards, since he had no
children and the hospital was so poor. The Spaniard did so, so that the
poor had thereby the milk necessary for their sicknesses, for milk is,
as a general rule, the delicacy that is prescribed to the sick in this
kingdom.</p>
<p>This province founded another hospital, in the port of Cavite, for
the relief and cure of the seamen in that port and of the natives who
live there. For its support and comfort they founded another ranch,
likewise of the larger cattle, the land on which that ranch was
established being given by some Spaniards and some natives, by the
advice and efforts of the religious.</p>
<p>The same Fray Juan Clemente founded another hospital outside the
walls of the city of Manila, which is called &ldquo;the hospital of the
natives;&rdquo; for there the Indian natives who go thither because
they have not the wherewithal to cure themselves are treated&mdash;and
they are many. The same religious founded another ranch for its
support, commencing it with some calves which he begged as an alms. In
the same manner was founded also the hospital of Los Ba&ntilde;os, with
two other ranches. In the city of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289"
href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>[Nueva]
C&aacute;&ccedil;eres, the religious have founded another hospital,
with another large ranch.</p>
<p>Within the city of Manila, the brotherhood of the Santa Misericordia
built another hospital, where poor negro slaves are treated, through
their alms. Most of the negroes would doubtless die miserably if the
Santa Misericordia did not piously aid them in so great need. The
Misericordia entrusted their hospital to our religious, who
administered it most willingly, as it was for poor creatures so
orphaned and destitute.</p>
<p>Besides these hospitals, there is the infirmary at the principal
convent of Manila, and another infirmary in the village of Pila, in the
province of Laguna de Bay of Tagalos. The province of Camarines has two
more infirmaries&mdash;one in the village of Camarines, and the other
(which is the chief one) in the city of [Nueva] C&aacute;&ccedil;eres,
the capital of that province. The religious of the order are treated in
those infirmaries, as well as the religious of other orders, secular
priests, and Spaniards, and not a few natives who gather there from
various villages&mdash;the priests being admitted to the same
infirmaries of the convents, and the laymen being accommodated in the
private houses of the villages.</p>
<p>The service, past and present, rendered to the two Majesties and to
their poor vassals by the religious in those hospitals and infirmaries
is of no little importance. But since the infernal enemy of the poor
does not sleep, he also found a plan to sow his seeds of discord and to
entangle everything, as is his wont. When Don Sebastian governed this
kingdom, he took the royal hospital away from the order, and commanded
it to be administered by layman and by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>secular priest. He
also took away the hospital of Cavite, and gave it to the religious of
San Juan Bautista,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2985src" href=
"#xd21e2985" name="xd21e2985src">1</a> whom he brought from
M&eacute;xico for that purpose. His Majesty (may God preserve him),
having been [correctly] informed, has ordered by his royal decree that
the royal hospital of Manila be returned to the order. In regard to the
hospital of Cavite, the order has not informed his Majesty of anything.
Without doubt the loss of the royal hospital of Manila is felt by the
order, for it contained as superior and minister one of the father
definitors, with another priest as associate (one of those who gave
most satisfaction), and the father vicar of the nuns, with an
associate. Besides these, there were four priests who were always
chosen from among the best of the province. It was necessary that they
be of the best, as they were in the sight of all the community. There
were also four or six lay religious, chosen for the same reasons from
the very best. The head-nurse was there and was chosen by the governor.
The steward, then as now, gave the religious what was needful for the
cure and comfort of the sick; and the religious gave out what was
delivered to them by the stewards, without having the management of any
property or money. And as that hospital always had a surgeon and an
apothecary (both Spaniards), the religious who served and ministered to
them learned medicine by experience, and by means of the books which
they read in the Romance [<i>i.e.</i>, Castilian] tongue. By that means
the other hospitals and infirmaries were furnished with nurses
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>and physicians so competent that the best people
of Manila preferred to be treated by them rather than by the Spanish
physician. Since the province has lost that hospital, the seminary of
its nurses is also lacking; and consequently only three or four of the
old nurses have remained, who now take care of the other hospitals. But
when they die, the province will sustain the hospitals with difficulty
for lack of nurse and school where they can be trained.</p>
<p>[Section iii treats of the conversion of China, and section iv of
the empire of Japan. Both have been treated sufficiently in preceding
volumes. The former mentions the disputes of the Franciscans and
Dominicans with the Jesuits over the Chinese rites. The latter narrates
the early beginnings of the Franciscans&rsquo; missions in Japan (where
they had ten convents and seven hospitals), their successes, and
subsequent persecutions.]</p>

"xd21e3035src">5</a> also died a martyr in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>the
same kingdom, because he had preached to the king in public three or
four times and chided him for his false worship of Mahomet. While he
was finishing mass in the house assigned to him by the king for his
lodging, and giving thanks, a troop of men attacked him and cleft his
head in twain; and when he was dead they dragged him along by his
girdle, and threw him into the river. He died in the year 1583.</p>
<p>The holy father, Fray Blas de Palomino,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3042src" href="#xd21e3042" name="xd21e3042src">6</a> a priest,
was going to Therrenate in a Portuguese ship. On arriving at the island
of Tagalonda, he asked the captain of the ship to put him ashore, and
the latter did so. On reaching shore he began to preach to those
islanders, but they speared him in sight of the ship. The father vicar
of Therrenate got a report of that murder and martrydom from the
Portuguese aboard that ship. In their report they said that father Fray
Blas de Palomino wore only a habit, and under that a hair-cloth shirt
which he wore quite commonly.</p>
<p>Brother Fray Juan de Palma,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3050src"
href="#xd21e3050" name="xd21e3050src">7</a> a lay-brother, was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>going to Espa&ntilde;a by way of India. The
Dutch captured the ship in which that religious was sailing. They shot
him with their arquebuses, although they did no harm to any of his
companions. It is said that they shot him because he preached to the
Dutch heretics; and it is a fact that the Dutch never treat a religious
badly unless he begins to preach to them.</p>
<p>Father Fray Ger&oacute;nimo de San Joseph,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3062src" href="#xd21e3062" name="xd21e3062src">8</a> priest,
embarked in the island Hermosa in a Chinese ship, with another
religious, Fray Jacinto, of [the order] of our father, St. Dominic.
Those religious intended to go to Jap&oacute;n, but the Chinese who
were taking them killed them, and cut off their noses, which they
salted. Thus did they carry these to Jap&oacute;n and presented them to
the emperor, who ordered them to be given the reward that had been
assigned to those who surrender and denounce evangelical ministers.</p>

<h3 class="main">VI</h3>
<h3 class="main">Foundation of the convent of our mother Santa Clara,
of this city of Manila</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This city of Manila has a cathedral, and five convents
of religious. Notwithstanding that, it was alone and as if an orphan,
for it had no convent of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>religious women. Especially did it
sigh for a convent of discalced nuns of our mother St. Clare. All
entreated and desired it, but no one had the wherewithal to found it.
God inspired the master-of-camp, Pedro de Chaves and his wife,
Do&ntilde;a Ana de Vera (who had no children or obligations), to spend
their possessions in the founding of that convent. They petitioned his
Majesty, who since he was so good a Catholic, immediately conceded it,
and sent the religious women, who came at the expense of his royal
treasury. Father Fray Joseph de Santa Maria, a venerable and perfectly
satisfactory religious, was then in Espa&ntilde;a, having returned to
that country from this kingdom. The royal Council summoned him from his
convent, where he was quietly remaining and resting after his long and
troublesome journey. His Majesty ordered him to conduct these
religious, and he received the commission very willingly, in
consideration of the great service that he was doing to both Majesties,
to this kingdom, and to the order. The said father Fray Joseph de Santa
Mar&iacute;a left Espa&ntilde;a with the following religious: Mother
Ger&oacute;nima de la Asunci&oacute;n, abbess, and as her associates
Mother Leonor de San Francisco, Mother Ana de Cristo, Mother
Mar&iacute;a Magdalena de la Cruz, Mother Magdalena de Cristo, Mother
Mar&iacute;a de la Trinidad. On departing they gave the habit to Mother
Juana de San Antonio and to Mother Luisa de Jes&uacute;s who performed
their novitiate during the voyage. The above religious were joined in
M&eacute;xico by Mother Leonor de San Buenaventura and Mother
Mar&iacute;a de los &Aacute;ngeles. During the second voyage
[<i>i.e.</i>, from Mexico to Manila] Mother Mar&iacute;a de la Trinidad
died, and thus the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296"
name="pb296">296</a>]</span>other nine religious arrived at Manila. On
arriving they were lodged in the convent of San P&aacute;loc, owned by
this province outside the walls of Manila, of which the patrons are the
same master-of-camp, Pedro de Chaves, and his wife, Do&ntilde;a Ana de
Vera, as they were its founders. While the women religious were in that
convent, the two novices, Juana de San Antonio and Luisa de
Jes&uacute;s, professed. The two patrons, husband and wife, immediately
prepared their houses, which were near the palace, and arranged them in
the manner of a convent, whither the religious betook themselves. A few
days after their arrival, the said master-of-camp, Pedro de Chaves,
died, and Do&ntilde;a Ana his wife being widowed, her nephew Don
Antonio de Vera, who married Do&ntilde;a Magdalena de Aybar, came from
Espa&ntilde;a. Do&ntilde;a Ana favored that gentleman as much as
possible, since he was her nephew; she brought about his marriage, and
made him a gift of all her property. Do&ntilde;a Ana de Vera died, and,
the convent of Santa Clara brought a suit, because of her foundation,
against the aforesaid nephew and niece, who remained as its patrons,
and their heirs. The suit was concluded, and the nuns were left in
possession of the houses of their founders, which had already been made
into a convent, for which they were not compelled to pay anything. The
said Don Antonio de Vera and his heirs were left in possession of a
good ranch which the first founders and patrons had given to the
convent for its support, provided that they abandoned and renounced all
their right of patronage over the said convent. Therefore the convent
was left to the mercy of God, without patron or property. In this way
there came an end to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href=
"#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>mountains of gold that its first
patrons promised to his Majesty for its foundation. The nuns began
immediately to receive crowds of girls, so that the dove-cot was filled
in a short time; and there are now fifty-six nuns. They do not receive
fixed dowries. The convent contains the daughters of the noblest and
richest men of Manila; but there are so many of them that the majority,
although noble, entered poor. From the money inherited by the convent
from some religious women whose fathers had property a church has been
built and part of the convent&mdash;which is a tolerably good building.
But it was so badly damaged by the late earthquake that it threatened
to fall, so that the nuns fear, and so do we all, especially the
province which has it in charge; but we cannot help it. Thus the
convent now has fifty-six nuns to support&mdash;without property,
without walls, and without patrons; nor do they know where they will
get them, and consequently they suffer what God knows. At first they
got along very well, for their parents and relatives were alive, and
the inhabitants of Manila, as they had property, aided with their alms.
But all that has ceased, and all Manila sees and bewails it. The
superiors who governed this [Franciscan] province in the past well
foresaw these times, and they accordingly ordered that the convent
should have some property; and they had some, and very good it was. But
the mother abbess, Ger&oacute;nima de la Asunci&oacute;n, and other
mothers who were among its founders, with the noble spirit that they
brought, and as alms did not fail them then, determined to profess the
first rule of our mother St. Clare, which does not allow temporal
possessions or property. They wrote about that to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>Espa&ntilde;a, and thus the convent was built
for them with the property that they possessed. Without doubt it
suffers pressing necessities, but the mothers live consoled, for the
poor gospeller is most consoled when he has least; and God, who
sustains the birds, sustains and will sustain this convent if it
maintains the rigor, poverty, and devotion that it professes.</p>
<p>News of the exceeding poverty and the religious life of this our
convent of Santa Clara of Manila reached Macau. That community
instantly petitioned for some religious women to found another convent
there. It was conceded, and the following religious, having received
their letters-patent and outfits, set sail for Macau: as abbess, Mother
Leonor de San Francisco, and as her associates, Mother Mar&iacute;a
Magdalena (these two being among those who came from Castilla la
Vieja); and of those who had received the habit in this convent of
Santa Clara of Manila, Mother Melchora de la Trinidad, Mother Clara de
San Francisco, Mother Margarita de la Concepci&oacute;n, Mother Juana
de la Concepci&oacute;n&mdash;six in all. The novitiate habit was given
on the ship to Marta de San Bernardo, a Pampango Indian woman, whom the
father provincial refused to allow to receive the habit in the convent
of Manila, because of that fact. But he gave her permission to receive
it on the sea, as she was so influential a woman and so moral and
virtuous; and on that account all the convent had urgently requested
it. Father Fray Ger&oacute;nimo del Espiritu Santo, a religious who was
thoroughly satisfactory to the province, accompanied those religious
women to Macau; and, after they had founded the convent of Macau,
Mother Mar&iacute;a Magdalena, Mother Margarita, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>Mother Clara returned to Manila by license of
the superiors. They brought a novice with them, namely, a daughter of
Captain Diego Enriquez de Losada, who came with them from Macau. The
father reader, Fray Antonio de Santa Mar&iacute;a, also returned with
them to this province; he had remained in Macau, because he had lost
his passage to Roma with the loss of Malaca.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VII</h3>
<h3 class="main">Some matters of special interest</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are various animals in this kingdom, as for
instance, carabaos or buffaloes, dogs, domestic and wild swine,
monkeys, and goats, and many deer in the mountains. The Spaniards have
brought here cows and horses. The cows have multiplied remarkably. The
horses are numerous, and are small. It is a land of many reptiles and
serpents; for it is damp and hot. In especial is there one species
known as <i>olopong</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3100src" href=
"#xd21e3100" name="xd21e3100src">9</a> There is no preservative or
antidotal herb against its bite. Others [<i>i.e.</i>, pythons] are
called <i>sauas</i>, which are very large. One of these will hang from
a tree, catch whatever living thing passes below&mdash;such as deer,
man, or swine&mdash;and swallow it whole. It has a very large and
excellent gall, which is a proved antidote for or preventive of
[poison]. The mountain Indians eat that snake. It breeds in the
mountains on the opposite coast of Valer and Palinan. The other animals
above mentioned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300"
name="pb300">300</a>]</span>are numerous throughout the kingdom. In the
same manner these islands abound in large and small fish. Tunnies are
caught on the opposite coast of Casiguran and in the lake of
Bong-bong&mdash;although as the country is so hot, few of them are in
good condition when they reach Manila. The most remarkable fish is the
crocodile, which here is called <i>buhaya</i>. It is a fierce animal,
[living in both] land and water, and thus sustains itself by hunting
and fishing, although it does not go far inland. The rivers and lakes
are full of those animals. In the province of Camarines there is a lake
of fresh water where there are so many crocodiles that the surrounding
villages collect to kill them; and they are accustomed to kill fifty,
sixty, or a hundred of the creatures. Their flesh is not eaten, and
hence they are good for nothing. There are also various species of
birds. They multiply but little, for the serpents eat them. The
principal birds are fowls like those of Espa&ntilde;a; other fowls,
smaller like partridges, which breed in the mountains; many
turtle-doves and pigeons, and <i>anades</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3132src" href="#xd21e3132" name="xd21e3132src">10</a> and ducks.
There are but few metals. The Indians get gold from their mines. Our
missions contain the mines of Paracali, and that village is supported
by the gold that is obtained there, for it has no other resources.
Those mines fill up immediately with water; and hence they are of no
importance to the Spaniards. But the Indians who are plodding, and work
little by little, get a sufficient quantity of it. A mine was
discovered in that village some years ago, from which considerable gold
was extracted. It filled with water and now a wonderful vein is seen
there. Some Spaniards <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=
"#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>have attempted to draw off the
water, because of the great wealth that it shows, but they have not
succeeded. Another mine, of copper, was discovered in that same village
of Paracale.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3142src" href="#xd21e3142"
name="xd21e3142src">11</a> Some copper, though little, was obtained
from it, and then it was abandoned because the cost was more than the
profit. There is a prolific mine of rock sulphur in the province of
Camarines. That province also has a very lofty and steep volcano which
is constantly throwing out streams of fire. Some years ago, an eruption
from it wrought damage to the neighboring villages. During these last
years, the noise and din that has been heard in the interior [of that
volcano] has been remarkable, and on that account the neighboring
villages are full of fear.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3151src" href=
"#xd21e3151" name="xd21e3151src">12</a> These islands also contain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>many civet cats, which breed in the mountains;
and many swarms of bees, from which the Indians get a quantity of wax.
There are forest trees for buildings and ships. There are many
excellent fruit trees. There are many kinds of bananas and oranges,
most of which have been brought by the Spaniards from China. The
oranges that the Indians had in their pagan state are very large, of
the size of a Spanish gourd; and the taste is pleasant and resembles
that of a grape. The Spaniards have also brought melons from
Espa&ntilde;a, China, and Jap&oacute;n; as well as radishes, cabbages,
lettuce, onions, and garlic; also camotes or potatoes, which have
resulted very well, and are a source of great support for this kingdom.
The Indians also formerly had other very good and useful roots, and
various kinds of kidney beans. The sugar-cane also is produced
throughout this kingdom, and a quantity of sugar is manufactured from
it, although, it is not so sweet as that of Espa&ntilde;a. Rice is the
principal product of this kingdom. It is abundant, and there are
various species of it; and it is harvested and sown throughout the
year. Wheat comes from China, and a quantity formerly came from
Jap&oacute;n. A quantity is also grown in this kingdom, although it is
degenerating yearly, and accordingly it is necessary to bring new seed
from Therrenate every fourth year. Our friars brought some shoots of
the clove in a pot for transplanting. They were transplanted in various
climates, and in different villages. Two shoots took root in the
village of Mahayhay and produced fruit, and the cloves were as good as
those of Therrenate. The first fruit that was gathered was sent to the
governor of these islands, Don Juan Zere&ccedil;o. Those <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>two
trees were lost afterward, and consequently none have been left in the
kingdom. Some grapevine shoots have been brought from China, which
after being transplanted in these islands have become good vines. The
arms which have been and are commonly used by the natives of the
kingdom are bows and arrows, a small lance and a shield of elongated
round shape, like a <i>pav&eacute;s</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3168src" href="#xd21e3168" name="xd21e3168src">13</a> The Indians
who live far from Manila are doubtless skilful in the use of the bow
and arrow. The Negrillos who wander through the mountains, and support
themselves by hunting, are very skilful. The latter people have no
government or settlements, and consequently they are not conquered.
Considerable cotton is gathered throughout the kingdom, from which the
Indians weave various kinds of cloth and textiles, of which they
manufactured their clothes and vestments when they were pagans. Now
they generally make them of mantas and pieces brought from China; and
thus they are clad very well, tastefully, and in clean garments. In the
province of Camarines, near the village of Malinas, there is also a
hot-water spring, which issues from the ground boiling. Consequently,
it destroys every living thing that falls into it; and, if wood or bone
falls into it, converts them into stone.</p>
<p>The tributes and the persons who confess, who were above enumerated
in each mission and ministry, were drawn from the lists which we have
in the government [offices]. Without doubt those of our missions are a
few more or less; for the exact number at present cannot be estimated
except by consulting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304"
name="pb304">304</a>]</span>the lists which are made for confession
every Lent. There are nearly seventy-six thousand among all the persons
who are ministered to in our missions.</p>

<h3 class="main">VIII</h3>
<h3 class="main">Foundation of this province of San Gregorio, and other
special events concerning it</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first founders of this province were discalced
religious, sons of the province of San Joseph, whose principal convent
is San Gil at Madrid; and accordingly this province was governed for
some years as a custodia of the said province of San Joseph, its
founder. And, since this was its custodia, the province of San Joseph
sent to it the orders for its government. The other discalced provinces
of Espa&ntilde;a also sent their religious, in order to have a share in
the abundant fruits of the conversion that have always been enjoyed in
this province. The province of San Joseph, considering, then, that it
was now time that this province&mdash;at that time its
custodia&mdash;should govern itself and have its own government,
petitioned his Holiness, Gregory Thirteenth, to erect it into a
province. His Holiness did so by his special bull, by which he makes it
a participant in all the apostolic briefs that have been or may be
hereafter conceded by the apostolic see to the said province of San
Joseph. In words truly weighty, and worthy of so great a pontiff, he
charged this province and its superiors with the zeal that they ought
to have in attending to the conversions in their care. His Holiness
especially charged the conversion of the great empire of China upon
them. In accordance with that action, father Fray Pablo de <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>Jesus was elected as the first provincial of
this province in the year 1590. From that time until our days it has
been preserved as a province, and it has been supplied with
Observantine religious. The latter in order to aid their brothers have
offered, with especial spirit, their health and lives to the Lord, and
have busied themselves in preaching His gospel; so that almost all the
provinces of Espa&ntilde;a, both of the Discalced and of the
Observantine, have religious sons who have been martyrs in this
province.</p>
<p>This province was founded in the rigor and poverty which the
Discalced of Espa&ntilde;a profess. In order to better preserve
themselves so, they petitioned his Majesty (may God preserve him) to be
pleased to aid them with his paternal alms, in order that they might
avoid in that way, as much as possible, the handling of money, which is
so contrary to the purity of our holy rule. His Majesty did that with
so holy and paternal a zeal that he ordered his governors and viceroys
by his royal decree to aid this province with what was needful to
clothe and cure the sick. This has been done and is being done, so that
his Majesty spends annually more than two thousand five hundred pesos
from his royal treasuries in sackcloth for habits, and in medicines,
for the sick in M&eacute;xico and Manila. This province, recognizing so
extraordinary an alms, and the other favors that his Majesty is doing
for it, considers his Majesty as its special patron; and refused the
patronage that the dukes of Medina Sidonia and Escalona asked
for&mdash;who offered their alms, favor, and protection. This province
sought excuse from their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href=
"#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>Excellencies by saying that they
could not make any innovation about that matter without an order from
his Majesty, for the said reasons.</p>
<p>While Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a was governing these islands by the
force of his valor and arms, he placed a garrison in the forts of
Therrenate. The soldiers being disconsolate without a convent of our
father St. Francis, the governors accordingly founded in those forts
the convent of San Antonio outside the walls of the city. Its first
beginning was poor and slight. Afterward, when Master-of-camp Cristoval
de Ascueta was governing the forts, he bought at his own cost some good
plank houses, in that same locality, which were owned by a Spaniard.
Therein, at his own cost and by his energy, he founded a church and
convent of planks, which had a spacious garden. That convent was
burned, as well as a hospital which the religious had built near it.
The religious, seeing themselves thus destitute, tried to come to
Manila, but Don Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora, who was governing this
kingdom at that time, would not allow them to come. Accordingly, he
sent an urgent order to Admiral Don Pedro de Heredia to rebuild their
house with especial care. The said admiral did so, with so singular
devotion that he rebuilt it in a short time, all of stone. Thus the
convent was founded and the religious sustained at the expense of his
Majesty (may God preserve him).</p>
<p>The religious of this convent have not been content with attending
to the consolation of the soldiers of those fortresses, and
administration of the sacraments to them, as the chaplains of his
Majesty, but they have always endeavored to plant the holy gospel in
the surrounding kingdoms. Fathers Fray Cristoval <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>del
Castillo, Fray Mart&iacute;n de San Juan, Fray Gregorio de San
Esteban,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3196src" href="#xd21e3196" name=
"xd21e3196src">14</a> Fray Pedro de la Concepci&oacute;n, and a
lay-brother, Fray Benito D&iacute;az, entered the kingdom of Manados,
where at various times they tried to convert that kingdom to the holy
gospel. Father Fray Diego de Roxas died there, occupied in the same
preaching of the holy gospel, with so much approbation of life that the
natives of the kingdom buried his body in a new sepulcher, which they
inclosed and preserved with so great veneration and respect that,
although our religious of Therrenate have gone there for his bones, the
natives have always refused to give them up. Father Fray Bias de
Palomino (of whom we made mention above) also returned from this
kingdom, to Therrenate, and, since he had already learned the languages
of those kingdoms, wished to preach in the kingdom of Tagalanda. He
disembarked for that purpose, trusting to those islanders, who, being
barbarians, killed him as above stated. Some of our religious of
Therrenate have entered the kingdom of Macasar for the same purpose of
preaching the gospel, and of offering the word of God on various
occasions to the kings of that kingdom. Although the latter did not
receive the word, they did not maltreat <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>the religious. On the
contrary, some villages, called Meados, which have preserved peace with
our Spaniards of Therrenate in the said kingdom of Manados, have been
very favorable to our religious. They have aided the forts with what
provisions they had there. In the years of the Lord, forty-three and
forty-four, some Spaniards who had gone to get provisions were in those
villages. The Indians rose up against them. Two religious were also in
the said villages, namely, father Fray Juan Yranzo and Fray Lorenzo
Garalda,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3201src" href="#xd21e3201" name=
"xd21e3201src">15</a> who had gone thither to convert the people. The
Indians killed some of the Spaniards. Father Juan Yranzo escaped with
some Spaniards, but father Fray Loren&ccedil;o was killed at that time.
When father Fray Vicente Argente,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3204src"
href="#xd21e3204" name="xd21e3204src">16</a> then the provincial
minister of that province, investigated the matter and how it had
happened, the witnesses declared that the Indians had refused to kill
father Fray Loren&ccedil;o, but that the priests of their idols
insisted upon it, by saying that they were very angry because priests
had been admitted into their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>kingdom who prevented their
idolatry. That was the reason why he suffered so many hardships. He
died seven days after. His body was found upon its knees, and the
Indians hid and kept it refusing to give it up. That religious was
always considered a man of excellent spirit and zeal. Father Fray
Bartolom&eacute; de San Diego<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3210src" href=
"#xd21e3210" name="xd21e3210src">17</a> and brother Fray Miguel de San
Buenaventura have been preaching to those islanders in the islands of
Calonga. Our religious have been in those kingdoms and in others near
Therrenate, on various occasions and at various times, ever trying to
reduce people so barbarous to the knowledge of our true God, although
always with but little fruit. May the will of God be done in all
things! The father reader Fray Gin&eacute;s de Quesada<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3213src" href="#xd21e3213" name=
"xd21e3213src">18</a> and father Fray Juan Yorillas,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3216src" href="#xd21e3216" name="xd21e3216src">19</a>
emulating the holy zeal of so many martyrs as Jap&oacute;n has had,
entered that country with remarkable courage, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>and
died there in the year 1633. Although we know that their death is
certain, we do not know how it happened. There are many reports, but
they are alike only in saying that those fathers were killed by
torture.</p>
<p>When Don Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora was governing these islands, the
emperor of Japon sent hither as many as one hundred and fifty exiled
Christian lepers. It is said that his intent was to spread that leprosy
among the natives of these islands, for it is a very common disease in
Jap&oacute;n. But whether that was the intent or no, it is a fact that
they were exiled because they were Christians; and as good Christians
they preferred to leave their country and their relatives rather than
their Christian worship and religion. All the city of Manila was
greatly edified at sight of them. But at length those who received them
into their charge were our holy order, who took them to the garden or
site of the hospital for the natives, built by the religious. They are
and have always been in that hospital, and the religious have sought
alms with which to sustain them, for they have cost no little care, and
do still. The governor assigned them alms from the royal treasury in
the name of his Majesty; and his Majesty, upon learning it, ordered,
since he is so good a Catholic, that two hundred ducados be given them
annually from his royal treasury.</p>
<p>Nothing can be done in the missions if the religious do not learn
the language of the natives. The religious of this province have always
occupied themselves in this with great assiduity, as they are so free
from property and business. The first missionaries left many writings
in the Tag&aacute;log and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>B&iacute;col languages, the best
of which are those left by fathers Fray Juan de Oliver, Fray Juan de
Plasen&ccedil;ia, Fray Miguel de Talavera,<a class="noteref" id=

they were the first masters of the Tag&aacute;log language, and since

They have not been printed, because <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>they are voluminous,
and there are no arrangements in this kingdom for printing so much.
Those things that have been printed, as being urgently needed for the
instruction of the natives, are the following. In the year 1613, father
Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3245src"
href="#xd21e3245" name="xd21e3245src">23</a> printed a Tag&aacute;log
vocabulary. In the year 1610, father Fray Ger&oacute;nimo Monte printed
in the Tag&aacute;log tongue <i lang="es">Oraciones devotas para
Comulgar y Confesar</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;<i>Devout prayers for
Communion and Confession</i>&rdquo;]. Father Fray Alonso de Santa
Ana<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3257src" href="#xd21e3257" name=
"xd21e3257src">24</a> explained and printed the <i lang="es">Misterios
de nuestra Santa fe</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;<i>Mysteries of our Holy
faith</i>&rdquo;] in the same Tag&aacute;log language in the year 1628.
In the year 1637, father Fray Joseph de Santa Maria translated into the
same language the <i lang="es">Doctrina</i> of Cardinal Bellarmino. In
a different style father Fray Antonio de San Gregorio tried to explain
the principal mysteries of our holy faith, in the year 1648. Father
Fray Andr&eacute;s de San Agust&iacute;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3273src" href="#xd21e3273" name="xd21e3273src">25</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=

in the province of Camarines in the B&iacute;col language (which is the
commonest and most universal of that province), in the year 1647; and
the translation that he made into that language of the <i lang=

id="xd21e3284src" href="#xd21e3284" name="xd21e3284src">26</a> in the

printed another <i lang="es">Tratado de Comuni&oacute;n y de
Confesi&oacute;n</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;<i>Treatise on Communion and
Confession</i>&rdquo;] with which the father ministers and these
natives have sufficient for study&mdash;the first, the so important
barbaric languages of these kingdoms; and the second, the so necessary
mysteries of our holy faith. The above is what has been printed in the
B&iacute;col language; and since the writings left by fathers Fray

first masters of that language, have not been printed, we shall make no
mention of them.</p>
<p>In the year nineteen or twenty his Majesty sent a goodly
re&euml;nforcement of men and money to this kingdom by his general Don
[<i>blank space in MS.</i>] de Huesola. That aid was lost on leaving
C&aacute;diz.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3318src" href="#xd21e3318"
name="xd21e3318src">29</a> In all of the galleons were sailing our
religious, who had been assigned as chaplains. Father Fray Juan de
Noves, with another priest, and a lay-brother, Fray Joseph de los
Santos, took passage in the galleon San Joseph. That galleon was
wrecked on the coast, as were the others. Its captain and pilot retired
to the stern, which is the highest part of the vessel. They had the
religious summoned who were down below, hearing confessions on the
quarterdeck. Father Fray Juan de Noves answered that he could not go,
for they were confessing the people, and that they could not leave all
those men without consolation. The lay-brother went, since he was not a
confessor, and was saved, with those who were at the stern. The two
religious who were confessors were lost, on account of hearing
confessions, with the others who were below decks. Most extraordinary
was the zeal displayed in this by father Fray Andr&eacute;s de
Puertollano.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3324src" href="#xd21e3324"
name="xd21e3324src">30</a> Returning to Espa&ntilde;a as custodian of
this province, he embarked at Vera Cruz in the almiranta <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>of
the fleet. That vessel was lost in a storm on some hidden rocks, and
was beached. The admiral went in his fal&uacute;a with what Spaniards
he could take, and father Fray Andr&eacute;s embarked with him. When
the poor wretches who were left behind in the wrecked galleon saw
father Fray Andr&eacute;s in the fal&uacute;a, they commenced to cry
out, saying: &ldquo;Father Fray Andr&eacute;s, why do you leave us in
these troubles?&rdquo; The religious, overmastered by impulse, sprang
into the water without saying anything; and went to the galleon to
confess those poor wretches, where he perished with the others.
Reverend Father Fray Juan de Prado, then commissary-general of the
order in M&eacute;xico, advised this province of that event. His most
reverent Paternity adds in his letter that he also had been advised, in
the report made to him of the matter, that the men aboard of the
fal&uacute;a saw father Fray Andr&eacute;s walk upon the water when
returning to the ship, just as if he were upon the land. The truth is,
as we all know, that father Fray Andr&eacute;s could not swim; and even
had he known how, he would have swum but ill, clad in a habit of
sackcloth so voluminous as that worn by the discalced religious. May
His Divine Majesty be pleased by it all, and may He give us His holy
Spirit so that we may all serve and praise Him!</p>
<p>O divine Providence! O eternal Predestination! we men work as men;
but Thou, O Lord, ordainest our works to incomprehensible ends, as an
omnipotent God! In the shipyard of Bagatas, which was established in
the province of Camarines, the Mindanao <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>enemy (whose worship
is the law of Mahomet) made a sudden attack. The galleon which was
being built was burned; and among other persons captured was father
Fray Domingo de los M&aacute;rtires, who was the confessor of the
shipyard, and a lay-brother, his associate and the nurse of the same
shipyard. They offered and sacrificed the lay-brother to their god or
idol, in a storm that burst upon them. They took the priest with them,
he preaching to them all the time and teaching them our evangelical law
whenever he saw a convenient opportunity for so doing. It happened that
a woman near his apartment who was pregnant came to her time; she had a
very painful labor, and bore an infant, still alive but breathing its
last. The religious begged leave of the mother to baptize it. He was
granted permission and baptized it, and shortly afterward it died and
went to heaven. Many blows and knocks did it cost the religious to
baptize it; but he afterward returned to this province where he died,
and where he recounted the above. Thus did the Mindanao enemy go to
Bagatas, burned the shipyard, captured two religious, sacrificed the
lay-brother to their idols, and preserved the life of the priest; and
for what end? Why did they not sacrifice them both? Because God had
predestined that infant for His glory, and likewise that the [Moro]
king should go to Bagatas, and attain his design, namely, the burning
of the shipyard; and that God should also attain His, namely, to take
that infant to His glory. Inasmuch as that had to be by the medium of
baptism, [He ordained] that the king should take a priest from Bagatas,
preserve his life, give him lodging near the pregnant mother, and that
the mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>should have a painful birth; that the religious
should learn of it, and with the mother&rsquo;s permission baptize the
infant; and that it should die at that instant, so that it should
instantly be translated from its Mahometan kingdom to that of Glory,
for so has divine Providence disposed and ordained.</p>
<p>Not less important was that which happened in the province of Tuy.
That province has some valleys enclosed by rough mountains, which are
bounded on the north by the province of Cagay&aacute;n, and on the east
by the village of Casiguran, (he last of our missions. Father Blas de
la Madre de Dios,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3339src" href="#xd21e3339"
name="xd21e3339src">31</a> during his provincialate, heard of these
people while in the province of Tagalos, and in order to reduce them to
civilization and to obedience to our God and our king, sent fathers
Fray Pedro de la Concepci&oacute;n and Fray Joseph Fonte to them, as
well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>as the brothers Fray Pedro de Saced&oacute;n and
Fray Baltasar de N. to act as nurses. Those religious lived in that
province for two years, and the Indians furnished them with what was
necessary, with all respect and kindness. A man already aged fell sick,
and, being harassed by his illness, begged to be taken to the
religious, who were in another village. On arriving he begged for holy
baptism, with tears in his eyes, and scarcely had he received it when
he died and went to heaven. This is the fruit that was drawn from that
journey, besides some small children who were baptized when in danger
of death, for whose predestination divine Providence seems to have thus
arranged. The same father provincial, Fray Blas de la Madre de Dios,
went with other religious to visit that province. Considering how poor
were the facilities for that conversion&mdash;for the people were
scattered in groups of huts, and had no villages or
government&mdash;and that between the said village of Casiguran and the
said valleys of Tuy intervene thickets and mountains inhabited by
savage Cimarrones; and that those mountains in themselves are very
rough, so that no one could go to and return from Tuy without
undergoing the worst kind of trouble and danger: therefore the father
provincial returned to his mission at Casiguran with all the religious.
The fathers of St. Dominic also went to those people by way of
Cagay&aacute;n, and also abandoned them for the same reasons as we.
From the above examples many others can be inferred in each conversion,
which are without doubt special and remarkable. In them and in all
things may our God and Lord be blessed and praised; and may His Divine
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>Majesty give us His holy grace so that we may
praise and serve Him in this and in the eternal life as His children!
Amen.</p>
<p>I look at the conversion of this kingdom of Philipinas in this way:
The happy day arrived on which God had determined to reduce all
Am&eacute;rica to the bosom of His holy Church. The kings of Francia
and Inglaterra disregard its conquest; the Catholic sovereign, although
in those times poorer and less powerful, receives it. Am&eacute;rica
having been conquered, reports are sent from Asia to Madrid testifying
of the islands of Salom&oacute;n and their wealth of gold and pearls.
The fleets of Espa&ntilde;a go to discover them, and although they
discover other kingdoms and islands of infidels, they do not halt
therein. The islands of Luz&oacute;n having been discovered, they are
conquered; and, having been conquered, are preserved. &ldquo;Then,
Sire, if the islands of Lu&ccedil;on do not contain the gold and pearls
that one imagined, why are they preserved?&rdquo; &ldquo;That makes no
difference,&rdquo; replies his Catholic Majesty, &ldquo;for I am
working as an instrument of divine Providence. The gold and pearls are
a very accidental object. The chief end is the conversion of the
kingdom of Lu&ccedil;&oacute;n, which God has specially predestined;
and He has chosen me, His king, as the instrument. And since the
principal end for the greater service of my God has been attained with
so great glory to myself and to my crown, the islands of
Lu&ccedil;&oacute;n will be preserved, although my treasures are
exhausted in their preservation.&rdquo; O, great God! how
incomprehensible by the usual means are Thy hidden purposes!&mdash;or,

<p>[To this account may be added the following information regarding
the Franciscan order in the Philippines, previous to 1640, from La
Concepci&oacute;n&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Hist. de Philipinas</i>, v, pp.
199&ndash;201:]</p>
<p>6. On the occasion of the conquest of the island Hermosa, and the
establishments therein, the province of San Gregorio resolved to found
their own convent there, in order that it might serve them as a
way-station to Japon and China. For that purpose their provincial sent
father Fray Gaspar de Alenda, and as his associate the lay brother Fray
Juan de San Marcos. Furnished with the necessary licenses and
despatches, they established in accordance with these a church and
convent, which they dedicated to their glorious father St. Francis; and
they maintained themselves there until the Dutch drove them thence,
with the death of their founder, father Fray Gaspar. Those fathers had
their troubles in Philipinas in their chief administration of
Camarines. By the death of Don Fray [Pedro] Mathias, the one chosen to
succeed him was the most illustrious Don Fray Pedro Godines, a
Franciscan, who did not come over to that church. The most illustrious
and reverend Don Fray Diego de Guevara, an Augustinian, who had been
prior of their convent of Manila, the first vicar-general of Japon, was
appointed. That prelate governed that church justly for three years,
when he suddenly departed this life. He was succeeded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>by
the most illustrious Don Fray Luis de Ca&ntilde;izares, a Minim, by
virtue of a royal decree of appointment and presentation; but in Mexico
another decree reached him, making him bishop of Honduras. As incumbent
of the vacant see in Camarines was substituted the most illustrious and
most reverend Don Fray Francisco de Zamudio, an Augustinian by
profession, from the province of Mechoacan. He began to govern in the
year one thousand six hundred and thirty-three and continued in his
office until that of thirty-nine, when he died suddenly. During his
government he tried to despoil the discalced Franciscans of various
missions in the province of Camarines and that of Ibalon or Albay. The
Franciscans defended themselves against that spoliation, and opposed
the decisions of the provisors of Manila and of Zeb&ugrave; in degree
of appeal, which were favorable to the bishop. They proceeded afterward
with their suit before the archbishop, Don Fernando Guerrero, and he
annulled those sentences, notwithstanding that favor [by the
provisors], in order to obviate quarrels and scandals, which were
inevitable in [attempting to] rectify affairs after such spoliation. As
the firm nature of the most illustrious Zamudio would not permit him to
comply with the archbishop&rsquo;s decree, the Franciscans yielded,
voluntarily and humbly, their rights declared and confirmed by sentence
of that court. The bishop also claimed [the right] to subject them to
the [diocesan] visitation and examination, in his execution of briefs
and decrees. That knotty question was discussed in the Audiencia. The
most illustrious Don Fray Diego Aduarte, bishop of Nueva Segovia,
having been summoned, responded to that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>tribunal, renouncing
his favorable right&mdash;which, although it was in favor of the miter,
was greatly injurious to the Indians. In order to avoid greater
injuries he renounced inferior rights, setting aside all these for the
good administration of his subjects.<a class="noteref" id=

Sebasti&aacute;n de San Jos&eacute; was born in Medina del Campo,
January 19, 1566, and at an early age was sent to the university of
Salamanca. At the age of nineteen (1585), he took the Franciscan habit
at the convent of Zamora. He reached the Philippines in 1605, where he
began to study the Tag&aacute;log and Japanese languages, in the
convent of Santa Ana of Sapa. He was appointed conventual preacher of
the Manila convent in 1608, and the following year was appointed
commissary-provincial for the islands of Maluco, arriving at Ternate in
February, 1610. In June of the same year he went to the island of
Macasar where he had great success. On returning from that island to
get aid for his missionary labors, he was attacked by the hostile
natives of the island of Tagolanda, and killed June 18, 1610. See

the Franciscan habit in 1602. He arrived at the Philippines in 1609,
and went in December of that same year to the missions of the Moluccas,
where, having been made a prisoner by the Dutch, he was ransomed by the
Spanish residents of Ternate. He was captured the following year by the
natives of Tagolanda who had killed Sebasti&aacute;n de San

Francisco de Santa Maria came to the Philippines in June, 1577, and
spent several years in missions there. In 1581 he went to China, and
afterward to Malaca. Returning to Manila in 1585, he set out two years
later for Spain; but his ship, fleeing from the Dutch, was obliged to
make port in Borneo. There he was slain by the natives (December,
1587), the first martyr among the missionaries, of all orders, sent to
the Philippines (Huerta, pp. 370, 371).</p>

Palomino was a native of Aud&uacute;jar and professed in the Franciscan
province of Granada, where he became master of novitiates. Going to the
Philippines in 1609, he was assigned to the province of Ituy where he
established the village of Ituy. In 1617 he went to the village of
Binangonan de Lampon, and in 1619 to the Moluccas; but after arriving
at Ternate he went to the island of Macasar. Having been ordered to
return to Ternate, he embarked in a Portuguese vessel, but being
treacherously entreated by some of the natives to return, he went back
to the shore (in the territory of Manados), where he was immediately

San Juan de la Ribera (March 25, 1607). He went to the Philippines in
1611, and in the following year was sent to Japan, where he labored
until 1614, when he was exiled and returned to Manila. In that city he
acted as procurator until 1623, when he set sail for Spain on various
matters of business. Being captured, however, en route by the Dutch, he

&ldquo;Copper ores are reported from a great number of places in the
Philippines; they are said to occur in Luzon, Mindoro, Panay, and
Mindanao. It is not probable that all of these are important, but
northern Luzon contains a copper region of unquestioned value. The best
known portion of this region lies about Mount Data, in the province of
Lepanto.... In this range copper was smelted by the natives long before
Magellan discovered the Philippines. The process consists of alternate
partial roasting and reductions to &lsquo;matte,&rsquo; and eventually
to block copper. It is generally believed that this process must have
been introduced from China or Japan. It is practiced only by one
peculiar tribe of natives, the Igorrotes. This tribe is in most
respects semibarbarous and lives in great squalor, though industrially
they stand on a high level, and show remarkable skill in the working of
metals as well as in their extraction. They have turned out not merely
implements of small dimensions, but copper kettles as large as three
and a half feet in diameter.&rdquo; (<i>Official Handbook of the

Gregorio de San Estevan is the only one of these religious mentioned by
Huerta. He professed in the Franciscan province of San Pablo, whence he
went to the Philippines. In November, 1609, he was appointed master of
novices in the Manila convent. It is supposed that he was in the
Moluccas about 1612, as he wrote a history of the martyrdom of
Sebastian de San Jos&eacute; and Antonio de Santa Ana. In March, 1622,
he was appointed guardian of the convent of Cavite, and in June of that
same year was elected definitor and vicar of the royal convent of Santa
